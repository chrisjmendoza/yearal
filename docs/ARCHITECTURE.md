# Architecture

Status: **current as of M0 and M1 complete; M2–M6 in progress** (2026-09-19). The toolchain is settled by
[adr/0001-toolchain.md](adr/0001-toolchain.md); [`gradle/libs.versions.toml`](../gradle/libs.versions.toml)
is the authority for versions and §1 explains the choices. Progress per task is in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

## How the planning docs fit together

| Doc | Authoritative for |
|---|---|
| [calendar-spec.md](calendar-spec.md) | IFC rules, conversion algorithms, the `IfcDate` type model, formatting, date-arithmetic semantics, test vectors |
| [FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md) | What the app does and in which release tier |
| **ARCHITECTURE.md** (this file) | Tech stack, module boundaries, data model, UI/widget architecture, testing, CI/CD |
| [holidays-and-import.md](holidays-and-import.md) | Holiday rule engine and data format, holiday data licensing, device-calendar overlay, `.ics` import/export |
| [security-and-privacy.md](security-and-privacy.md) | Threat model, permissions, backup rules, Play policy, repo hygiene |
| [competitive-analysis.md](competitive-analysis.md) | Evidence behind priorities; naming collisions |
| [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) | Milestones, task breakdown for parallel agents, open questions |
| [WORKFLOW.md](WORKFLOW.md) | How work is done: the gate, Definition of Done, KDoc standard, anti-drift rules, rules for LLM agents |
| `gradle/libs.versions.toml` | The dependency versions the build actually uses (§1 explains the choices) |
| [device-test-matrix.md](device-test-matrix.md) | The on-device checks the automated gate cannot make (ROADMAP M5 T8) |
| [screenshots.md](screenshots.md) | Recording, reviewing and committing Roborazzi goldens; reading a CI diff |
| [reviews/](reviews/2026-09-19-astra-analysis-response.md) | External reviews of the project and our written response to each |
| [contracts/](contracts/Events.md) | Frozen public APIs that parallel tasks build against: [Calendar.md](contracts/Calendar.md) (`:core:calendar`, frozen M1 T6) and [Events.md](contracts/Events.md) (events, frozen M4 T1) |
| [adr/](adr/) | Decisions made after this baseline |

When two docs disagree, the doc that is authoritative for that topic wins, and the other gets fixed.

## Decisions at a glance

| Topic | Decision |
|---|---|
| Language / UI | Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Material 3 with dynamic colour, single activity |
| SDK levels | minSdk 26 (native `java.time`), targetSdk 36, compileSdk 37 |
| Correctness keystone | `:core:calendar` — pure Kotlin/JVM, zero Android dependencies, exhaustively tested; **no date is ever computed outside it** |
| Storage | Room 3 + bundled SQLite driver for events; DataStore for settings. Dates are stored Gregorian (epoch day); IFC is a view. The only IFC data at rest is IFC-anchored recurrence rules |
| Time | Injectable `Clock`; `LocalDate.now()` is banned outside the `Clock` binding; no epoch-millisecond arithmetic |
| DI / navigation | Hilt; Navigation 3 |
| Widgets | Jetpack Glance; one exact alarm per day at local midnight + system-broadcast receivers + `updatePeriodMillis` backstop |
| Holidays | Own pure-Kotlin rule engine, bundled JSON rule packs, computed per year, never stored |
| Network | None in 1.0 — no `INTERNET` permission. No analytics, ads, or accounts, ever |
| Tests | JVM-first: JUnit 6 + Kotest property tests for pure modules; Robolectric + Roborazzi for UI; emulator only for nightly smoke tests |
| CI | GitHub Actions: format check, lint, all JVM tests, screenshot verification, debug assemble on every branch push and pull request (local work pushes a branch and merges on the owner's word; cloud work opens a PR — see [WORKFLOW.md](WORKFLOW.md) §1) |

## Reconciled decisions

The planning docs were written in parallel and disagreed in a few places. These are the rulings.

1. **`IfcDate` type model** — the sketch in calendar-spec §4 is the one to implement: a sealed
   interface with `Regular`, `LeapDay`, and `YearDay`, the `monthNumber` / `dayOfMonth = 29`
   pseudo-fields, and **no bare `dayOfWeek`** (only `nominalDayOfWeek?` and `actualDayOfWeek`).
   §3.1 below adds `IfcYearMonth` on top of it for grid layout.
2. **Canonical numeric form** — `IFC YYYY-MM-DD` with months `01`–`13`, Leap Day `06-29`, Year Day
   `13-29` (calendar-spec §7.3). It sorts correctly and keeps a plain int triple. The `IFC ` prefix is
   mandatory in anything a user can see.
3. **Month arithmetic from an intercalary day** — defined, clamping like `java.time`
   (Leap Day + 1 month = Sol 28), per calendar-spec §7.7.
4. **Yearly recurrence on Leap Day in common years** — per-event policy `JUNE_28 | SKIP | SOL_1`.
   User-created events default to `JUNE_28` (IFC June 28 is Gregorian June 17 in common years, so the
   Gregorian date never moves). The built-in Leap Day holiday is simply absent in common years.
5. **Exhaustive test range** — every day of years 1–9999 (≈3.65 M days; seconds on the JVM), matching
   the reference script that produced the spec's vectors, rather than a narrower window.
6. **UI year range** — pickers and the converter accept 1583–9999 with a proleptic-calendar note at the
   low end; the library accepts 1–9999 (calendar-spec §7.1).
7. **Weekday display default** — `BOTH`: nominal IFC weekday headers with the actual weekdays in a
   second header row. Everything tied to real life (today highlight, events, reminders) uses the actual
   weekday. To be validated with testers during internal testing.
8. **Holiday rule model** — the rule types and JSON format in holidays-and-import.md supersede the
   shorter list in §3.3 below. Lunisolar holidays come from tables generated at development time, so
   `:core:holidays` stays pure JVM.
9. **`.ics` parsing** — not decided here. A hand-rolled VEVENT parser and the `biweekly` library are
   both on the table; parsing untrusted files favours a maintained library behind our own interface.
   Settled by an ADR when the import milestone starts. RRULE expansion uses `lib-recur` either way.
10. **Release scope** — 1.0 ships without any calendar permission and without network access.
    Device-calendar overlay is 1.1, `.ics` import/export and file backup 1.2, URL subscriptions 1.3.
    The agenda widget (the first widget to show event text) ships in 1.x together with the widget
    privacy mode.
11. **Exact alarms** — reminders are the justification for `USE_EXACT_ALARM`; the midnight widget
    rollover reuses it when present and must work without it (windowed alarm + system broadcasts +
    `updatePeriodMillis`). No Play build declares the permission before reminders ship. See §5.
12. **Release signing** — the upload key stays offline and the 1.0 release bundle is signed on the
    owner's machine; CI proves the tag builds but does not hold the key. CI signing is an optional
    later convenience. Play is the only binary distribution channel at 1.0. See §7.
13. **No database encryption** — SQLCipher is rejected (§8). Sensitive-data exposure is handled where
    it actually happens: widgets, lock-screen notifications, exports, and backups.

## Development environment

Found on the development machine on 2026-09-17:

- Android Studio 2026.1.2 (Quail 2) with bundled JBR (OpenJDK 21.0.10) at
  `C:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio\jbr`. Quail 2 supports AGP up to 9.3.
- SDK at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Android\Sdk` with platforms 35, 36 and 37 (37 was installed by AGP itself during
  the M0 spike — the licence is accepted on the machine, so a missing platform is fetched on first build).
  `cmdline-tools` are not installed and the build does not need them.
- `JAVA_HOME` and `ANDROID_HOME` are not set and `java` is not on `PATH`.

Command-line Gradle needs a JDK to launch the wrapper. Either set the variables once at user level:

```powershell
setx JAVA_HOME "C:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio\jbr"
setx ANDROID_HOME "%LOCALAPPDATA%\Android\Sdk"
```

or per shell session (what agents should do):

```powershell
$env:JAVA_HOME = "C:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio\jbr"; $env:PATH = "$env:JAVA_HOME\bin;$env:PATH"
```

Gradle runs on JDK 21 and compiles to a Java 17 bytecode target in every module. The daemon JDK is
pinned by `gradle/gradle-daemon-jvm.properties` (Java 21, any vendor; generated by Android Studio via
`updateDaemonJvm`). Locally the JBR satisfies it and in CI Temurin 21 does, so nothing is downloaded in
practice; the foojay URLs in that file are only a fallback for a machine with no JDK 21. Modules do not
declare Java toolchains of their own, so compilation never triggers JDK provisioning.

## 1. Tech stack (version-catalog-ready)

### Build and platform

| Key | Artifact / plugin | Version | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| gradle | Gradle wrapper | 9.7.1 | Latest stable (2026-08-19) and already cached locally. AGP 9.3 needs 9.5.0 or later. |
| agp | com.android.application / com.android.library | 9.3.3 | Latest patch of the newest line that the installed Studio Quail 2 supports. Move to 9.4.x only after updating Studio to Quail 4. |
| kotlin | Kotlin (jvm plugin, compose plugin, serialization plugin) | 2.3.21 | Pinned below the latest stable (2.4.20) on purpose: KSP has no verified Kotlin 2.4 line (issue google/ksp#2965 is open). Room and Hilt both depend on KSP. |
| ksp | com.google.devtools.ksp | 2.3.12 | Latest (2026-09-09). |
| compileSdk / targetSdk / minSdk | | 37 / 36 / 26 | Compose 1.12 forces compileSdk 37. Play has required target 36 for new apps since 2026-08-31. minSdk 26 gives `java.time` without desugaring. |

### UI and AndroidX

| Key | Artifact | Version | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| composeBom | androidx.compose:compose-bom | 2026.09.00 | Resolves to Compose 1.12.1, material3 1.4.0 and adaptive 1.3.0. |
| material3 | androidx.compose.material3:material3 | 1.4.0 (via BOM) | Dynamic color on API 31 and later, brand fallback palette below that. |
| adaptive | material3.adaptive, adaptive-layout, adaptive-navigation, material3-adaptive-navigation-suite | 1.3.0 (via BOM) | NavigationSuiteScaffold and list-detail layouts. |
| glance | androidx.glance:glance-appwidget, glance-material3, glance-appwidget-testing, glance-preview, glance-appwidget-preview | 1.2.0 | Stable (2026-08-26). Adds `providePreview` and `setWidgetPreview`. |
| room3 | androidx.room3:room3-runtime, room3-compiler, plugin `androidx.room3` | 3.0.3 | See the decision below. |
| sqlite | androidx.sqlite:sqlite-bundled | 2.7.1 | The bundled driver gives the same SQLite on every device and allows plain JVM DAO tests. |
| datastore | androidx.datastore:datastore | 1.2.1 | Typed `DataStore<UserSettings>` with a kotlinx-serialization JSON serializer. No protobuf toolchain. |
| nav3 | androidx.navigation3:navigation3-runtime, navigation3-ui | 1.1.7 | See the decision below. |
| lifecycle | lifecycle-runtime-compose, lifecycle-viewmodel-compose, lifecycle-viewmodel-navigation3 | 2.11.0 | Needs compileSdk 37, which is fine here. |
| activity | activity-compose | 1.13.0 | |
| coreKtx / splashscreen / window / profileinstaller | | 1.19.0 / 1.2.0 / 1.5.1 / 1.4.1 | |
| work | androidx.work:work-runtime | 2.11.2 | Transitive through Glance. Used only lightly; see section 5. |

### Dependency injection, Kotlin libraries, tests and lint

| Key | Artifact | Version | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| hilt | com.google.dagger:hilt-android, hilt-compiler (KSP), plugin | 2.60.1 | See the decision below. Needs AGP 9 and Gradle 9.1 or later, which are both met. |
| androidxHilt | androidx.hilt:hilt-lifecycle-viewmodel-compose, hilt-work | 1.4.0 | |
| coroutines | kotlinx-coroutines-core, -android, -test | 1.11.0 | |
| serialization | kotlinx-serialization-json | 1.11.0 | Nav keys, the settings serializer, and holiday-set JSON. |
| junit6 | org.junit:junit-bom (Jupiter) | 6.1.3 | Pure-JVM modules only. Parameterized and dynamic tests suit golden vectors. |
| junit4 | junit:junit | 4.13.2 | Android modules. Robolectric, the Compose test rule and Roborazzi are all JUnit4. |
| kotest | kotest-property, kotest-assertions-core | 6.2.5 | Used as libraries under JUnit, not as the Kotest runner. |
| turbine | app.cash.turbine:turbine | 1.2.1 | |
| robolectric | org.robolectric:robolectric | 4.17 | First release with SDK 37 support (2026-09-10). Very fresh. |
| roborazzi | io.github.takahirom.roborazzi (plugin, core, compose, junit-rule, compose-preview-scanner-support) | 1.74.0 | See the screenshot-testing decision below. |
| androidxTest | core / runner / rules / ext-junit / espresso | 1.7.0 / 1.7.0 / 1.7.0 / 1.3.0 / 3.7.0 | |
| spotless / ktlint | com.diffplug.spotless / ktlint | 8.10.2 / 1.8.0 | Formatter and style gate. |
| lint | Android Lint | built into AGP | Correctness gate. Set `warningsAsErrors = true` and check in a baseline. |
| recur | org.dmfs:lib-recur | 0.17.1 | RRULE expansion for `Recurrence.Gregorian`, behind `RecurrenceExpander.supports` (M4 T3). Apache-2.0; pure Java 8 bytecode with no `java.time` or Java 9+ API use, so it is safe at minSdk 26. About 165 KB, plus `org.dmfs:rfc5545-datetime` 0.3 (33 KB) and `org.dmfs:jems2` 2.23.1 (143 KB). Used by Etar and OpenTasks. |

### Stack decisions

- **Hilt over Koin or manual DI.** Compile-time graph validation catches agent mistakes at build time. Each feature module wires itself with `@HiltViewModel` and `@Module`, so `:app` does not become a merge hotspot. Koin fails at runtime, and manual DI funnels all wiring through `:app`.
- **Navigation 3 over Navigation Compose.** Navigation Compose 2.9.8 is in maintenance. Nav3 is stable, and its back stack as a plain list of `@Serializable` keys is trivial to unit-test and to synthesize from widget and notification intents. The 1.2.0-rc01 release adds a deep-link matcher and a `ResultEventBus`; adopt it once it is stable.
- **Room 3 over Room 2.8.5.**
  - Room 3 is KSP-only, coroutines-only and built on SQLiteDriver. Starting on it avoids a forced `androidx.room` to `androidx.room3` migration later.
  - Agents trained on Room 2 will reach for `androidx.room.*`, so state the Room 3 package in CLAUDE.md.
  - If Room 3 blocks M4, Room 2.8.5 plus the bundled driver is a mechanical downgrade.
- **Roborazzi over Paparazzi or Compose Preview Screenshot Testing.**
  - It is the only option that renders full Compose, activities and Glance on the JVM through Robolectric.
  - Compose Preview Screenshot Testing is still alpha (0.0.1-alpha16) and is being re-homed into AGP 9.5 test suites.
  - Paparazzi cannot host activities or Glance.
- **ktlint through Spotless plus Android Lint, no detekt.** detekt 2.0 is alpha only (alpha.6), and detekt 1.23.8 predates Kotlin 2.3. Revisit when 2.0 is stable.
- **No mocking library.** Use hand-written fakes in `:core:testing`. They are more deterministic for agents.
- **Deliberately absent:** Firebase, Play Services, analytics and network libraries. The app is offline-first with no accounts, and that also keeps it eligible for F-Droid.

### Flagged as unverified, to be settled by the M0 spike

**Settled on 2026-09-17 by [adr/0001-toolchain.md](adr/0001-toolchain.md)** — items 1–3 and 5 verified
by a real build (Kotlin 2.4.20 passed the Room/KSP spike but is not adopted yet); item 4's
`lifecycle-viewmodel-navigation3` exists at lifecycle 2.11.0; lib-recur was settled at 0.17.1 by M4 T3
(see the table above); `adaptive-navigation3` and the Android 17 behaviour review remain open for M3/M7.
The original list is kept for the record:

1. **Kotlin 2.4.20 with KSP 2.3.12, Room 3 and Hilt.** Evidence is mixed. KSP2 is decoupled from the compiler, but its own "Upgrade to Kotlin 2.4.0" issue is open and third parties report lock-out. The plan is to start on 2.3.21, try 2.4.20 on the scaffold, and bump only if it is green.
2. **Kotlin 2.3.21.** The exact patch was inferred from the Dagger 2.60 release notes. 2.3.20 is known good with AGP 9.3 on this machine, so fall back to it if 2.3.21 does not resolve.
3. **Hilt, Room 3 and Roborazzi Gradle plugins under AGP 9 defaults** (`android.newDsl=true`, built-in Kotlin).
   - Dagger 2.59 and later claim AGP 9 support.
   - Opting out (`android.newDsl=false`) sidesteps the question, but a greenfield project should not, because the opt-out is removed in AGP 10.
   - Under built-in Kotlin, Android modules do not apply `org.jetbrains.kotlin.android`. Raise KGP by declaring the `org.jetbrains.kotlin.jvm` plugin version at the root.
4. **Nav3 companion artifacts.**
   - `lifecycle-viewmodel-navigation3`: the docs sample shows 2.12.0-alpha03. Confirm that it ships at lifecycle 2.11.0 stable.
   - `adaptive-navigation3`: the docs sample shows 1.4.0-alpha02. Confirm whether it is in adaptive 1.3.0 stable. If it is not, hand-roll a two-pane Scene in M3 (about 100 lines).
5. **DataStore 1.2.1.** One Google page says 1.2.0 and another says 1.2.1; 1.2.1 is known to resolve.
6. **lib-recur version.**
7. **Release dates.** The summarizer garbled years on the GitHub release pages. Version numbers are reliable; treat dates as approximate.
8. **Android 17 (target 37) behavior changes.** Not reviewed. That is why targetSdk starts at 36 and the bump is a post-launch roadmap item.

### Dependency direction

Dependencies are strictly one-way: `feature:*` and `widget` depend on `core:designsystem`, `core:navigation`, `core:domain` and the pure-JVM `core:holidays`; `core:designsystem` depends on `core:domain`; `core:domain` depends on `core:calendar`.

- Features depend on `:core:domain` interfaces and never on `:core:data`.
- Only `:app` depends on `:core:data`, `:core:scheduling`, `:core:devicecalendar` and `:widget`. It needs them to put the Hilt bindings on the classpath.
- Features never depend on other features. Cross-feature navigation goes through `:core:navigation` keys.
- Add a Gradle check in the feature convention plugin that fails the build if a `feature` module depends on another `feature` or on `:core:data`.

Three pure-JVM modules hold all the logic that must be correct. They build and test in seconds with no Android toolchain, which makes them ideal for delegated agents.

### Package naming

Base: `io.github.chrisjmendoza.yearal` (the app is **Yearal**, ROADMAP.md decision #1, 2026-09-18). This is also the applicationId, which can never change after the first Play upload.

- A GitHub-derived reverse domain is legitimate, free, and matches a public repo.
- The namespace for each module is `<base>.core.calendar`, `<base>.feature.events`, and so on.
- The applicationId equals the base.

### build-logic

Yes, add it, but keep it minimal. With about 17 modules, copy-pasted `android {}` blocks are the top source of agent drift.

- Plugins, modelled on Now in Android and written against the AGP 9 new-DSL `CommonExtension`
  (shared code in `IfcAndroid.kt`; the API-shape rules are in [adr/0001-toolchain.md](adr/0001-toolchain.md)):
  - `ifc.jvm.library`: Kotlin JVM, Jupiter, Kotest, `explicitApi()`, Dokka KDoc gate.
  - `ifc.android.library`: SDK levels from the catalog, Java 17, lint as an error gate, JUnit4 + Robolectric.
  - `ifc.android.compose`: Compose compiler, BOM dependencies, Roborazzi.
  - `ifc.android.feature`: library, compose and hilt, plus the standard `:core:*` dependencies, Turbine, and the dependency rule check (fails on `:feature:*` → `:feature:*` or `:core:data`).
  - `ifc.android.application`: target SDK and the SemVer `versionCode`.
  - `ifc.hilt`: Hilt + KSP.
  - `ifc.kotlin.serialization` and `ifc.room`: the compiler plugins must be applied from `build-logic`'s classpath (ADR 0001, decision 3).
- Spotless is configured per module by the convention plugins (ktlint from the catalog).
- Do not write custom tasks beyond these.

## 3. Domain model

### 3.1 `:core:calendar`

The rules, algorithms, type model, formatting, and arithmetic semantics are specified in
[calendar-spec.md](calendar-spec.md) (§3, §4, §7). This module implements that spec and nothing else.
In brief: the IFC day-of-year equals the Gregorian day-of-year, so conversion is pure integer
arithmetic, and two invariants are worth remembering — Sol 1 is always Gregorian June 18, and Year Day
is always December 31.

`IfcDate` is the sealed interface from calendar-spec §4 (`Regular`, `LeapDay`, `YearDay`). On top of
it, this module provides the layout type the month grid and range queries are built on:

```kotlin
data class IfcYearMonth(val year: Int, val month: IfcMonth) {
    val firstDay: LocalDate
    val trailingIntercalary: IfcDate?             // LeapDay for June in leap years; YearDay for December; else null
    val gregorianRange: ClosedRange<LocalDate>    // 28 days, or 29 incl. trailing intercalary - ALWAYS contiguous
    fun actualDayOfWeek(column: Int): DayOfWeek   // constant down the column (28 = 4 whole weeks)
    fun plusMonths(n: Long): IfcYearMonth
}
```

**Design decisions:**

- The arithmetic core works on `(year, dayOfYear)` ints and an `epochDay` Long. `java.time` is a thin adapter layer, which keeps a later KMP port cheap.
- Validation happens at construction: day 1 to 28, Leap Day only in leap years, years 1 to 9999 (proleptic Gregorian, same as `java.time`).
- The canonical numeric text form is `IFC YYYY-MM-DD` with Leap Day `06-29` and Year Day `13-29` (calendar-spec §7.3). `parse` accepts it with or without the prefix; formatting for display always includes it.
- Day and week arithmetic delegates to `LocalDate`. Month and year arithmetic works on the IFC fields and clamps the way `java.time` does (calendar-spec §7.7).
- `explicitApi()` is on. The public API is frozen at the end of M1 and documented in [contracts/Calendar.md](contracts/Calendar.md).
- There is no Android code, no localization and no display formatting here. Names live in resources in `:core:designsystem`.

**Weekday insight for the UI.** Every month is 28 days, so the actual weekday of grid column k is constant within a month. It is constant across the whole year up to an intercalary day, and it shifts by one after Leap Day.

- In 2026, 1 January is a Thursday, so every IFC "Sunday" column in 2026 is an actual Thursday.
- Column headers can therefore show both weekdays cheaply, for example `Sun` with a small `Thu` under it.
- Code still obtains the actual weekday from `toLocalDate().dayOfWeek` and never derives one weekday from the other (calendar-spec §4.1).

**Golden vectors** live in calendar-spec §6 (105 machine-generated pairs plus negative vectors). They are copied into `:core:testing` as a CSV and are the acceptance test for this module. Spot check: Gregorian 2026-09-17 is IFC September 8, 2026 — nominal Sunday, actual Thursday.

### 3.2 Events

Events are anchored to Gregorian wall-clock time. Instants are derived and never stored.

The domain models, `EventRepository`, `RecurrenceExpander`, `ObserveAgendaUseCase`, the rule-text grammar
and the fakes are **frozen in [contracts/Events.md](contracts/Events.md)** (M4 T1); the points this section
left open are decided in [adr/0005-events-contract.md](adr/0005-events-contract.md).

```

```

- **IFC recurrence** is modelled as `sealed IfcRecurrence { YearlyOnDate(month, day), YearlyOnIntercalary(day), MonthlyOnDay(day) }`, plus `interval` and `until/count`.
  - `YearlyOnIntercalary(LeapDay)` carries a common-year policy, `JUNE_28 | SKIP | SOL_1`. User-created events default to `JUNE_28`, which keeps the Gregorian date at June 17 every year. The rule text always spells the policy out (`COMMONYEAR=`).
  - The event's start is occurrence 1 and must be a position of the rule; the text form (`ifc_rule`, `X-IFC-RRULE`) is implemented once, in `IfcRuleText` (grammar in [contracts/Events.md](contracts/Events.md) §3).
  - IFC rules expand in O(1) per year by direct construction, `IfcDate.Regular(y, m, d).toLocalDate()`, with no iteration.
  - Gregorian rules go through lib-recur with fast-forward.
  - There is no materialised occurrences table. `RecurrenceExpander` in `:core:domain` is pure and property-tested.
- **Scope cuts:**
  - Version 1 supports edit all, delete all, and delete one occurrence (EXDATE).
  - Per-occurrence overrides (an `event_overrides` table) come after 1.0.
  - User-defined holidays are yearly all-day events with `category=OBSERVANCE`, so they need no extra table.
  - ICS export writes `ifc_rule` as `X-IFC-RRULE` plus a Gregorian-approximate fallback.
- **Time zones:**
  - A non-null `zone_id` keeps the wall time fixed in that zone. A null `zone_id` follows the device.
  - Expansion yields `Occurrence(eventId, startLocal, endLocal, zone, allDay)` with **nominal** wall-clock values.
  - Bucketing by day converts each occurrence to the device zone (`Occurrence.dates(deviceZone)`); all-day occurrences are never shifted. A wall time in a DST gap happens later by the length of the gap, one in an overlap is the earlier instant; durations are nominal and ends exclusive (ADR 0005).
- **Reminders** use a single next-alarm pattern: only the earliest upcoming reminder is scheduled, as one PendingIntent.
  - When it fires, the app posts the notification, then recomputes and reschedules.
  - It also recomputes on event writes, boot, time or zone changes, and app update.
  - This pattern never approaches the 500-alarm cap.
  - All-day reminders fire at a configurable local time, 09:00 by default.
  - `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` is requested in context, the first time the user adds a reminder.

**As built (M6 T1, `:core:scheduling`, package `core.scheduling.reminder`).**

- `AlarmReminderScheduler` is the `ReminderScheduler` of [contracts/Events.md](contracts/Events.md) §5 and
  a `DayRolloverListener` (§5 below) in one `@Singleton`: `reschedule()` is the only entry point and the
  rollover hook just calls it. It is bound in `:core:scheduling`'s own `SchedulingModule` (`@Binds` plus
  `@Binds @IntoSet`), replacing the documented no-op `@Provides` that stood in `:app`'s `EventsModule`. It
  takes `EventRepository` as a `javax.inject.Provider`, because the production repository injects a
  `ReminderScheduler` to call after each write and taking it directly would be a Dagger cycle.
- One call does everything: read the clock and `ZoneProvider`, ask
  `EventRepository.getReminderCandidates(today)` (visible calendars, events with reminders), turn each
  candidate into trigger instants through `RecurrenceExpander.nextOccurrence` — that is `ReminderPlanner`,
  a pure function with its own oracle tests — post what has come due, and arm **one** alarm for the
  earliest instant still ahead, or cancel the alarm when there is none. Nothing is cached between calls
  except how far delivery has got, so a late delivery, a backwards clock change and a flight across zones
  all come out right.
- **Reference instants.** Timed: `Occurrence.start(deviceZone)`, so DST gaps and overlaps resolve by the
  frozen rule on `Occurrence`. All-day: 09:00 in the device zone on the occurrence's first date. The
  "configurable" part of the bullet above is **not built**: `UserSettings` has no reminder-time field
  ([contracts/Events.md](contracts/Events.md) §6 puts one out of 1.0 scope), so 09:00 lives as
  `ReminderPlanner.ALL_DAY_REMINDER_TIME`, which is the single definition of it.
- **Late reminders** — one whose instant passed while the device was off, in Doze, or before the process
  existed — are delivered late if they are no more than 15 minutes old, and dropped otherwise. Late
  delivery is what makes a reminder survive a reboot at all, since a reboot cancels every alarm and the
  app is only called again at `BOOT_COMPLETED`; the bound keeps a phone that was off for a week from
  emptying a fortnight of reminders into the shade. A high-water mark inside the singleton stops the same
  reminder being posted twice, which is what makes recomputing on every repository write free. The mark is
  in memory, so a fresh process may re-post a reminder from the last 15 minutes once; ids are stable, so
  that replaces the same notification rather than adding a second one.
- **Work is bounded.** At most one occurrence per calendar date and at most
  `ReminderPlanner.MAX_OCCURRENCES_PER_EVENT` (64) occurrences per event are examined; the walk normally
  stops after two, as soon as no later occurrence of that event could produce an earlier instant.
- **Notifications** are [security-and-privacy.md](security-and-privacy.md) §3.3's: one channel, title and
  time only, `VISIBILITY_PRIVATE` with a redacted public version, no full-screen intent, stable ids
  derived from ids, and a tap that opens the app through an explicit, extras-free `PendingIntent`. On API
  33+ the permission is checked immediately before posting; denied means nothing is posted and the alarm
  is still armed, so the app works in full without notifications (FEATURES P2).
- **Around it:** the in-context `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` request is the event editor's (`:feature:events`), and
  `IfcApplication.onCreate` calls `reschedule()` off the main thread through `AppStartup` on every process
  start, so a reminder alarm lost to a force-stop or an OEM task killer is back as soon as anything starts
  the app. **Not built:** tap routing to the event (`IntentRouter`) and snooze.

### 3.3 Holidays

Holidays are computed, never stored.

- The rule types, modifiers, and the bundled JSON format are specified in [holidays-and-import.md](holidays-and-import.md): `fixed`, `nthWeekday` (negative n = last), `offset`, `easter` (western and orthodox), `table` (pre-generated lunisolar dates), and `ifc`, with `observed` policies and `since/until` bounds. In code this is a `sealed HolidayRule` hierarchy in `:core:domain`.
- A set is `HolidaySet(id, region, name, sources, holidays)`, loaded from JSON resources in `:core:holidays`
  by `HolidayPackLoader`; the engine is `HolidayEngine` in `:core:domain`. Decisions the spec left open
  (rule year vs anchor year, observed entries, memoisation key, the `SUNDAY_TO_MONDAY` policy) are in
  [adr/0003-holiday-rule-model.md](adr/0003-holiday-rule-model.md); the schema decisions in
  [adr/0004-holiday-pack-format.md](adr/0004-holiday-pack-format.md).
- Evaluation per year takes microseconds and is memoised.
- Enabled set IDs live in DataStore.
- `HolidayEngine` is bound in `:feature:calendar` (`di/HolidayModule`) and `HolidayPackLoader` in `:feature:settings`; both move to `:app` if a third module needs them. The IFC observances set and the US pack are enabled by default; any set, the IFC one included, may be switched off in Settings (`UserSettings.enabledHolidaySets`). Version 1 ships the "IFC observances" set (Year Day, Leap Day, Sol 1) and the US pack (federal holidays plus common observances). Lunisolar tables are a 1.0 stretch goal that can slip to 1.1 without affecting the engine. More sets are data-only PRs.
- **`HolidaySetProvider`** (`:core:domain`, M4 T6) is the one seam "which sets are enabled" flows through: `enabledSets(): Flow<List<HolidaySet>>`, the bundled packs already filtered to `UserSettings.enabledHolidaySets`. `:core:domain` cannot depend on `:core:holidays` (dependency direction, §2), so the production implementation, `PackHolidaySetProvider`, lives in `:feature:calendar` next to `HolidayEngine` and is bound there (`di/HolidayModule`); `ObserveAgendaUseCase`'s own binding lives in `:app` (`di/AgendaModule`) and receives it across the Hilt component the same way `HolidayCatalog` already receives `HolidayPackLoader` from `:feature:settings`. `HolidayCatalog` (grid and Day-detail label formatting) is unchanged and keeps evaluating `HolidayEngine` itself from an explicit `enabledSetIds` argument, since it needs arbitrary set ids for previews and per-call flexibility that a `Flow`-shaped provider does not give for free; the provider's job is only to give `ObserveAgendaUseCase` the same "enabled" definition without loading `:core:holidays` types into `:core:domain`.
- Device calendars (M7) are a read-only overlay through `CalendarContract.Instances`, queried on the same Gregorian range. The feature is opt-in and the `READ_CALENDAR` prompt appears in context.

### 3.4 Month-grid query

1. `IfcYearMonth.gregorianRange` gives a contiguous `[start, end]` of 28 or 29 days.
2. `ObserveAgendaUseCase(range): Flow<Map<LocalDate, DayAgenda>>` combines four sources:
   - **Non-recurring events:** `WHERE recurrence_type=0 AND start_epoch_day <= :end+2 AND end_epoch_day >= :start-2`. The two-day padding (`EventRepository.ZONE_SKEW_DAYS`) covers zone skew: offsets span UTC−12..UTC+14, so a zoned event can show two dates away from its own. Filter exactly in Kotlin.
   - **Recurring candidates:** `WHERE recurrence_type!=0 AND start_epoch_day <= :end+2 AND (recurrence_until_epoch_day IS NULL OR >= :start-2)`. This is a small set. Expand it in memory and subtract exdates.
   - Both come from `EventRepository.observeAgendaCandidates(range)`, restricted to visible calendars.
   - **Holidays:** `holidays(year, enabledSets)` filtered to the range.
   - **Device instances:** optional.
3. Bucket the results by local date. The UI maps dates to cells through `IfcDate.from`. The map holds only dates that have something on them.

The pager keeps three months warm with `beyondViewportPageCount = 1`: `MonthViewModel` calls `ObserveAgendaUseCase.invoke` once per warm month (its own page plus one neighbour on each side) and reads `DayAgenda.entries.size` for the grid's event-dot counts (FEATURES C4); Day detail and Today query it for exactly one day each. The Year view issues one range query for the whole year and returns only a presence bitmap (`ObserveAgendaUseCase.presence(range): Flow<Set<LocalDate>>`, event occurrences only).

## 4. UI architecture

### Screens and navigation

- **Bottom bar / rail:** the top-level destinations, via `NavigationSuiteScaffold`, are **Today | Calendar | Events | Convert | More**. "More" holds Holidays, Settings, Learn/About and Privacy.
- **Nav keys** live in `:core:navigation`: `TodayKey`, `MonthKey(year, month)`, `YearKey(year)`, `DayKey(epochDay)`, `ConverterKey(prefillEpochDay?)`, `EventListKey`, `EventEditorKey(eventId?, prefillEpochDay?)`, `MoreKey` (the hub tab), `HolidaysKey`, `SettingsKey`, `LearnKey`, `PrivacyKey`.
- **Per-tab back stacks** are `TabBackStacks` in `:app`: one `NavBackStack` per tab, the Today root prefixed when another tab is shown so that back from a tab root returns to Today; the Calendar tab's root `MonthKey` is resolved from `DateTicker` when the tab is first opened.
- **Entry providers:** `:app` owns the per-tab back stacks (the Nav3 "top-level back stack" recipe), the single `NavDisplay`, and its `entryProvider` block, which registers one `entry<XKey> { XRoute(...) }` per nav key directly in [`ui/IfcApp.kt`](../app/src/main/kotlin/io/github/chrisjmendoza/yearal/ui/IfcApp.kt) — features do not expose their own `EntryProviderScope` extension; each just exports its `XRoute` composable(s) for `:app` to wire up.
- **Intent routing:** widget and notification taps send explicit intents with extras. `IntentRouter` in `:app` builds the back stack, for example `[MonthKey, DayKey]`. No URI deep links are needed until Nav3 1.2 is stable.
- **Screen behaviors:**
  - **Today:** the hero IFC date, the Gregorian equivalent, both weekdays, year progress, today's agenda, and the next intercalary day or holiday.
  - **Month:** a `HorizontalPager` of months (done: an app bar with a Today action, a jump-to-date action (FEATURES C7) and the visible page's own title; each page's `MonthGrid` carries the same heading text inside the grid; holidays come from `HolidayCatalog`, which evaluates the enabled packs with `HolidayEngine` for the visible page ±1). The app bar's title mirrors the visible page's `MonthGrid` heading and is itself the tappable control that zooms out to **Year** (docs/ROADMAP.md M3 T2) — done this way, rather than making the grid's own heading tappable, because the grid is a shared `:core:designsystem` component and the zoom-out is `:feature:calendar` behavior. The jump-to-date action opens a small calendar chooser (Gregorian or IFC, the event editor's own pattern) and pushes the chosen date's `MonthKey`. **Year** is 13 mini-months in a `LazyVerticalGrid(Adaptive(160.dp))`, each drawn as a single `Canvas` rather than 28 real day cells (`YearMiniMonthTile`, `:core:designsystem`) — 364 real cells visibly cost frames while scrolling the grid. On a two-column phone, Year Day takes the 14th slot.
  - **Converter:** one chosen day and a direction switch (done). Gregorian → IFC picks the date in the Material 3
    `DatePickerDialog`; IFC → Gregorian uses `IfcDatePicker`. Both live in `:core:designsystem` (`picker` package) so the
    M4 event editor can reuse them, both are limited to `DatePickerRange` (1583–9999, reconciled decision 6), and the
    Material picker's UTC-millisecond API is adapted to `LocalDate` inside the wrapper, with no millisecond arithmetic.
    `IfcDatePicker` is stateless over an immutable `IfcDatePickerValue` (year as typed + selected day): Year Day is always
    offered, Leap Day only in leap years, and a selected Leap Day moves to June 28 — with a visible, announced notice —
    when the year becomes a valid common year (calendar-spec §7.10). The default input is today from `DateTicker`;
    `ConverterKey.prefillEpochDay` overrides it when it lies in range and is ignored otherwise. Input lives in the
    ViewModel's `SavedStateHandle` as primitives and is re-validated on restore. The result shows both dates, the numeric
    `IFC` form, both labelled weekdays, and the proleptic note for years up to 1923 (the latest adoption calendar-spec
    §7.1 names); copy and `ACTION_SEND` text always carry the `IFC` marker and the Gregorian date.
  - **Day detail:** a bottom sheet on compact widths (done: a material3 `ModalBottomSheet` inside the Nav3 entry — Nav3 1.1.7 has no sheet scene, only `DialogSceneStrategy`) and a pane on expanded widths (M3 T4). It shows both dates, both weekdays and the day's events, with "Add event" and "Open in converter" actions. An agenda row's long-press (also a TalkBack custom action) opens a delete confirmation: "delete this occurrence" for a recurring event — an `EventRepository.addExdate` on the occurrence's own start date, never the day the sheet is showing (`docs/contracts/Events.md` §4) — with an undo snackbar, or a plain, permanent delete for a one-off event (M4 T8).
  - **Learn** (done, M3 T3, `:feature:settings`): static sections (what the IFC is, the floating days, nominal-vs-actual weekdays, how dates are calculated, a brief history, an FAQ) plus an expandable-FAQ list. Every worked-example date is computed through `:core:calendar` (`LearnFacts`) and rendered with `IfcDateFormatter`, never typed as a literal.
  - **Privacy** (done, the in-app half of M2 T12, `:feature:settings`): a static, truthful statement of what the app stores and what its two declared permissions (`RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED`, `WAKE_LOCK`) are for, sourced from `docs/security-and-privacy.md`'s allow-list; the hosted-policy URL is left blank until one exists.

### State management

Use plain unidirectional data flow with no MVI framework.

- An `@HiltViewModel` exposes one `StateFlow<XUiState>` built with `stateIn(WhileSubscribed(5_000))`, plus public intent functions.
- `XRoute(viewModel)` collects with `collectAsStateWithLifecycle`. It delegates to a stateless `XScreen(state, callbacks)`, which is the unit for previews, Roborazzi and Compose tests.
- "Today" comes from `DateTicker: Flow<LocalDate>` in `:core:domain`:
  - It emits the current date, then delays to the next midnight.
  - **As built (ROADMAP R1).** `RealDateTicker` takes an optional `TimeChangeSignal` (`:core:domain`;
    default `NoTimeChangeSignal`, a source that never fires, so every existing caller is unchanged): a
    `Flow<Unit>` of invalidation hints with no payload. On each cycle it races the midnight delay against
    the signal — whichever comes first — then always re-reads `Clock` and `ZoneProvider`, emits only if
    the recomputed date differs from the last one emitted, and arms a fresh delay to the new next
    midnight. A firing that changes nothing produces no duplicate emission; a clock moved backwards
    across a boundary emits the earlier date. `AndroidTimeChangeSignal` (`:app`,
    `io.github.chrisjmendoza.yearal.time`) is the Android implementation: it fires on a context-registered
    `RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED` receiver for `TIME_SET`, `TIMEZONE_CHANGED` and `DATE_CHANGED`
    (`docs/security-and-privacy.md` §6.3), and on every activity resume through
    `Application.ActivityLifecycleCallbacks` (not `ProcessLifecycleOwner`: `lifecycle-process` is not a
    dependency of this app, and every resume, not only the first foregrounding, is a safe moment to
    recompute). Construction does no registration; `IfcApplication.onCreate` calls its `start()` once,
    the same place it arms the day-rollover alarm, so a half-constructed instance is never handed to
    `registerReceiver`/`registerActivityLifecycleCallbacks`. `TimeModule` binds it and passes it to
    `RealDateTicker`.
  - The same `TimeChangeSignal` also reaches `DefaultObserveAgendaUseCase.invoke`/`presence`
    (`:app`'s `AgendaModule`, default parameter for source compatibility), so a zone change re-buckets
    an already-open Month/Day/Today/Year screen's agenda even though `ZoneProvider` itself is a plain
    synchronous read, not a flow, and none of the repository or holiday-set flows emit on their own
    (`docs/contracts/Events.md` §5).
- Never call `LocalDate.now()` outside the `Clock` binding.

### Intercalary days in a 7-column grid

- The grid is always exactly 4 rows by 7 columns.
- June in leap years and every December gain an **intercalary band** below row 4.
  - It is one full-width pill spanning all seven columns.
  - It shows a label ("Leap Day" or "Year Day"), the Gregorian date and the real weekday.
  - It uses the tertiary-container color plus an icon, and it is tappable like any other day.
  - The slot height is measured from real text (`intercalarySlotHeight()`), because non-linear font scaling breaks any "line height × N" estimate; months without a band show the month's Gregorian span in the placeholder.
- Spanning every column makes "belongs to no week" visible. No weekday header aligns with it.
- The same component serves the Year view's Year Day tile (the grid's 14th item) as a thin bar, and the
  widget. Leap Day, inside the Year view's compact June tile rather than its own grid item, uses a
  smaller non-interactive inline indicator instead (an icon, the label, an event dot and a hollow
  today ring, never colour alone) so that tile stays one TalkBack node; tapping anywhere in the tile,
  the indicator included, opens June.
- A `WeekdayDisplay { NOMINAL, ACTUAL, BOTH }` setting drives the headers. `BOTH` is the default: nominal IFC weekdays with the actual weekdays in a second header row.

### Adaptive layouts

- Navigation is a bar on compact widths and a rail on medium widths and up.
- Calendar becomes list-detail on expanded widths, with Month on the left and Day detail on the right. It uses the Nav3 Scenes list-detail strategy if `adaptive-navigation3` is stable, otherwise a small custom two-pane Scene.
- Events list and editor use the same pattern.
- The app is edge-to-edge (enforced at target 36), supports predictive back, and does not lock orientation. Target 36 ignores orientation locks on sw600dp and up anyway.

### Accessibility

- Cells are at least 48dp. Seven columns at 360dp gives 51dp.
- Each cell has a merged description, for example "Sol 13, IFC Friday. Gregorian Tuesday, June 30, 2026. 2 events. Holiday: …", with "Today." appended on the current date.
- Use `selected` and `Role.Button` semantics, a heading on the month title, and traversal groups on the grid.
- Today, holidays and intercalary days are never encoded by color alone. Each also has a shape or icon.
- Screenshot tests run at font scale 2.0. Respect the reduced-motion setting.

### Localization

- All strings are in resources from day one, including the 13 month names with "Sol".
- The IFC date pattern is a positional string resource, `%1$s %2$d, %3$d`, so locales can reorder it
  (`date_long_regular`, `date_long_intercalary`, `date_medium_*` in `:core:designsystem`; `IfcDateFormatter`
  formats them with its own `Locale` via `String.format`, not `Resources.getString(id, args)`, so the
  numerals follow the formatter's locale).
- Gregorian dates use `DateTimeFormatter.ofLocalizedDate`.
- Weekday names come from `DayOfWeek.getDisplayName`.
- Numerals are formatted with the locale.
- RTL comes for free from `Row`.
- Per-app language uses AGP `generateLocaleConfig`.
- Version 1 ships in English only.

## 5. Widget architecture (Glance, in `:widget`)

### Widget types

1. **Today:** sizes from 2x1 to 2x2. It shows the IFC date large, with an optional Gregorian line and weekdays.
2. **Month grid:** 4x3 and larger. It uses the same 4x7 grid plus band and marks today, event dots and holidays. Rows are nested containers, because Glance caps a container at 10 children. Seven columns and at most six rows fit.
3. **Agenda:** the next N occurrences. It ships in 1.x, together with the "hide event details" widget privacy mode, because it is the first widget that shows event text on the home screen.

All widgets use `SizeMode.Responsive` with three sizes, `GlanceTheme` dynamic colors, and tap actions that open the app at a `DayKey`.

### Data

- `provideGlance` pulls repositories through a Hilt `@EntryPoint`.
- It computes "today" from the injected `Clock` at composition time, so any update trigger self-corrects.
- It collects the agenda flow while the Glance session is alive.
- Repository writes call `WidgetUpdater.requestUpdate()`. The interface lives in domain, and the implementation is here as a debounced `updateAll`.

### Midnight rollover (layered)

1. **Primary:** one `AlarmManager.setExactAndAllowWhileIdle(RTC_WAKEUP, nextLocalMidnight + about 1s)`. It fires `updateAll` and re-arms itself. One wakeup per day has negligible battery cost.
   - Permissions: declare `USE_EXACT_ALARM` (API 33 and later, auto-granted and not revocable) and `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` with `maxSdkVersion="32"` (granted by default on API 31 and 32). **Declared since M6 T3**; the Play Console text is [security-and-privacy.md](security-and-privacy.md) §5.4.
   - **Event reminders are what justify the exact-alarm permission** — Play explicitly allows it for calendar apps that show event notifications, and requires a Play Console declaration. The widget rollover merely reuses it. No build uploaded to Play declares `USE_EXACT_ALARM` before reminders ship (M6).
   - This route avoids the Android 14 denied-by-default `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` flow entirely.
   - Always guard with `canScheduleExactAlarms()` and fall back to `setWindow` with a 10-minute window. Pre-reminder builds, and any build where Play rejects the declaration, run on the windowed alarm plus layers 2 and 3, so the design must be correct without exact alarms.
2. **Manifest receivers**, all on the implicit-broadcast exemption list or package-targeted: `TIME_SET`, `TIMEZONE_CHANGED`, `LOCALE_CHANGED`, `BOOT_COMPLETED` and `MY_PACKAGE_REPLACED`. Each one updates the widgets and re-arms the rollover and reminder alarms.
   - `ACTION_DATE_CHANGED` is **not** exempt, so it cannot be registered in the manifest at target 26 or later. It is used only context-registered, inside `DateTicker`, while the app is alive.
3. **Self-healing backstop:** `updatePeriodMillis` of 4 hours in the provider XML. It needs no code, recovers from OEM alarm killing or force-stop, and re-arms the alarm.
   - Do not add a periodic WorkManager job. Glance already uses WorkManager internally for sessions.

**As built (M5 T2, `:core:scheduling`).** Layers 1 and 2 exist and are armed in every build; layer 3 arrives with the first widget (M5 T1).

- **The hook is `DayRolloverListener`** (`:core:domain`, package `core.domain.rollover`): `suspend fun onDayRollover(trigger: DayRolloverTrigger)`, with one trigger per source (`MIDNIGHT`, `TIME_CHANGED`, `ZONE_CHANGED`, `LOCALE_CHANGED`, `BOOT_COMPLETED`, `APP_UPDATED`). `:core:scheduling` declares the Hilt multibinding `Set<DayRolloverListener>` with `@Multibinds`, so the empty set is valid and the module is complete and wired into `:app` before any widget exists. `:widget` contributes a listener with `@Binds @IntoSet` that calls its `updateAll`; since M6 T1 `AlarmReminderScheduler` contributes another (itself) that recomputes its next alarm for every trigger. Wherever this section says a trigger "updates the widgets and re-arms the reminder alarms", it happens through these listeners; `:core:scheduling` never learns who listens. `WidgetUpdater.requestUpdate()` stays what "Data" above says it is — the repository-write path (M5 T6) — and is not the rollover hook. `RecordingDayRolloverListener` in `:core:testing` is the fake.
- **A call is a hint, not a fact.** Listeners recompute "today" from the injected `Clock` and `ZoneProvider` every time and never infer the date from the trigger or the alarm's nominal time; that is what keeps the rollover correct on the windowed alarm, after late delivery in Doze, and after the clock is set backwards.
- `DayRolloverScheduler.arm()` sets one `RTC_WAKEUP` alarm for `nextLocalMidnight + 1 s`. "Next local midnight" is `today.plusDays(1).atStartOfDay(zone)` from the `Clock` and the `ZoneProvider` (DST-safe, including zones where 00:00 does not exist); the only conversion to epoch milliseconds is the `AlarmManager` call. The `PendingIntent` is explicit, immutable, has a fixed request code and no extras, so re-arming replaces the alarm and never stacks one.
- ~~**Pre-reminder builds use the windowed alarm on every API level (26–36)**, not only where `canScheduleExactAlarms()` is false.~~ **Superseded by M6 T3**, which declared the permissions. Android Lint's `MissingPermission` rejects any `setExactAndAllowWhileIdle` call, guarded or not, while the manifest declares neither exact-alarm permission, which is why the `canScheduleExactAlarms()` branch of layer 1 had to land in the change that declares them.
- **As built (M6 T3).** Both alarms are set through one internal helper, `armWakeup` (`ExactAlarms.kt`), which is the single place the exact-versus-windowed decision is taken: `setExactAndAllowWhileIdle` when `Build.VERSION.SDK_INT < 31` (an exact alarm needs no permission there) or `canScheduleExactAlarms()` is true, and `setWindow` with the 10-minute window otherwise. The capability is read on **every** call, never cached, because an API 31–32 user can revoke it at any moment; `SystemEventReceiver` also listens for `ACTION_SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM_PERMISSION_STATE_CHANGED` (a sixth action, package-addressed like `MY_PACKAGE_REPLACED`) and re-arms both the rollover and the reminder alarm under the new capability, notifying no listener, since the date has not changed. The windowed branch is not an error path: nothing in the design treats it as degraded, and the scheduler tests cover both states on API 26, 30, 31, 33 and 36.
- `DayRolloverAlarmReceiver` and `reminder/ReminderAlarmReceiver` (neither with an intent filter) and `SystemEventReceiver` (the actions of layer 2, plus the exact-alarm one) are declared in the library manifest with `android:exported="false"`; all check `intent.action` and read nothing else from the intent. A rollover receiver re-arms **first**, synchronously, then notifies the listeners concurrently on a background scope under `goAsync()` with an 8-second budget. A listener that throws or hangs does not stop the others; the failure is rethrown after the broadcast is released, not swallowed. The reminder receiver has the same shape through its own `ReminderBroadcastHandler` and the same 8-second budget, but no listeners: it only asks `AlarmReminderScheduler` to recompute.
- `IfcApplication.onCreate` arms the alarm on every process start (one `AlarmManager` call, no listener is notified), which is how an alarm lost to force-stop or an OEM task killer comes back.

Never update a widget per minute. The widgets show dates, not clocks.

**As built (M5 T1, `:widget`).** The Today widget (`TodayGlanceWidget` + `TodayWidgetReceiver`) is the
first thing in `:widget`, on Glance 1.2.0.

- `TodayGlanceWidget.provideGlance` resolves `Clock` and `ZoneProvider` through the Hilt `WidgetEntryPoint`
  (`@EntryPoint`, resolved with `EntryPointAccessors.fromApplication`, exactly like `:core:scheduling`'s
  `SchedulingEntryPoint` — Glance instantiates the widget itself, not Hilt). The composable content calls
  `todayDate(clock, zoneProvider)` directly, every composition, with no `remember`: this is what "at
  composition time" above means in code. `IfcDateFormatter` and the tap-hint string are read once per
  `provideGlance` call instead, since they do not depend on the date and reading `Locale.getDefault()`
  inside the composable itself trips Compose lint's `NonObservableLocale` check for no benefit (Glance
  content is not recomposed by a locale change the way an Activity's is; the `LOCALE_CHANGED` trigger
  already forces a fresh `provideGlance` through `WidgetRolloverListener`).
- `WidgetRolloverListener` (`@Binds @IntoSet` into `:core:scheduling`'s `Set<DayRolloverListener>`; renamed
  from `TodayWidgetRolloverListener` in M5 T3, once it covered more than one widget) calls a small
  `WidgetRefresher` seam (`GlanceWidgetRefresher.refreshAll` updates every widget the module owns, one
  `updateAll` call each) so the listener is unit-testable without a real `AppWidgetManager`.
- Three `SizeMode.Responsive` breakpoints, `SMALL` (110x40dp, 2x1: date only), `MEDIUM` (180x40dp, adds
  the Gregorian line) and `LARGE` (180x110dp, adds the labelled actual weekday), matching
  `res/xml/today_widget_info.xml`'s `minWidth`/`minHeight`/`minResizeWidth`/`minResizeHeight` and
  `res/xml-v31/today_widget_info.xml`'s additional `maxResizeWidth`/`maxResizeHeight`/`targetCellWidth`/
  `targetCellHeight` (introduced in API 31; Android Lint's `UnusedAttribute` rejects them below minSdk 26
  in a single file, hence the two files — a `-v31` resource replaces the base file wholesale on API 31+,
  it does not merge attribute-by-attribute). `widgetCategory="home_screen"` only, not `keyguard`
  (docs/security-and-privacy.md §3.2: a date-only widget stays lock-screen eligible on Android 16 QPR2+
  by default, so nothing extra needs declaring).
- The tap action opens the app through `launchAppIntent`, which resolves the launcher via
  `PackageManager.getLaunchIntentForPackage` rather than naming `MainActivity` — `:widget` cannot depend
  on `:app` (§2) — then `androidx.glance.appwidget.action.actionStartActivity(intent)`. `IntentRouter`
  (M3 T5) does not exist yet, so no extras are added; the app simply opens on its normal start
  destination.
- `GlanceTheme` uses Material You dynamic colour on API 31+ (`GlanceTheme.colors`) and the brand palette
  (`BrandLightColorScheme`/`BrandDarkColorScheme` from `:core:designsystem`, wrapped by
  `androidx.glance.material3.ColorProviders`) below it.
- Glance depends on WorkManager, which unconditionally declares `WAKE_LOCK`, `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` and
  `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` alongside `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED` (already declared by `:core:scheduling`).
  `:widget`'s manifest keeps `WAKE_LOCK` (WorkManager's own reliability mechanism for the widget's
  background render) and strips the other two with `tools:node="remove"`, verified safe from the actual
  work-runtime and glance-appwidget sources rather than assumed — see
  docs/security-and-privacy.md §5.1 for the detail and the allow-list entries.

**As built (M5 T3, `:widget`).** The Month-grid widget (`MonthGlanceWidget` + `MonthWidgetReceiver`,
package `widget.month`) is the second widget in `:widget`, built the same way as Today.

- `MonthGlanceWidget.provideGlance` reaches `Clock`/`ZoneProvider` through the same `WidgetEntryPoint` as
  Today. The composable calls `todayDate(clock, zoneProvider)` every composition (no `remember`) and
  derives the month to show from it with `IfcYearMonth.from(today.ifcDate)` — an intercalary today
  (Leap Day or Year Day) resolves to the month it follows, so the widget always shows a real month, never
  a page for a single floating day. `buildMonthWidgetState` (`widget/month/MonthWidgetState.kt`) is the
  pure function that shapes this into what the content renders: the month title, both weekday header rows
  (nominal and actual, from `IfcYearMonth.actualDayOfWeek`, never derived from each other per calendar-spec
  §4.1), the 28 day cells with a Gregorian-date-matched `isToday` flag, the trailing Leap Day / Year Day
  band from `IfcYearMonth.trailingIntercalary`, and the Gregorian span.
- Two `SizeMode.Responsive` breakpoints (the task's minimum): `COMPACT` (250x180dp, about 4x3 home-screen
  cells — `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §5's "Month grid: 4x3 and larger") shows the grid with one actual-weekday
  header row and no Gregorian span line; `FULL` (320x320dp) adds the nominal weekday header row too — the
  app's `BOTH` default (Reconciled decisions #7) — plus the Gregorian span line. `res/xml/month_widget_info.xml`
  and the `res/xml-v31` split mirror the Today widget's pattern exactly, with `targetCellWidth`/`Height` at
  4x3 and the same 4-hour `updatePeriodMillis` backstop.
- Today is marked by shape and weight, never colour alone (CLAUDE.md rule 3; FEATURES Q4): a rounded,
  filled pill behind a bold day number, or — when today is the intercalary day — the band itself switches
  from the tertiary container to the primary container plus bold text. Glance 1.2.0 has no border/outline
  modifier (unlike the app's own `MonthGrid`/`IntercalaryBand`, which use a border ring), so the widget
  uses a filled shape instead; both satisfy "shape, not colour alone".
- One merged content description (month, today's IFC date with both labelled weekdays, and the Gregorian
  equivalent, built from `IfcDateFormatter.dayDescription`) sits on the whole tappable widget, the same
  place Today puts its description. The 28 day-number `Text` elements and the two header rows carry no
  semantics of their own — deliberately not the app's full-grid pattern of one rich description per cell
  (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §4 "Accessibility"), which would put 28-plus nodes on a home-screen widget.
  Glance/RemoteViews in 1.2.0 has no modifier to mark a child unimportant for accessibility, so a screen
  reader may still traverse the day numbers individually; this is a platform limitation, not a design
  choice, and is worth revisiting if Glance adds one.
- The tap action reuses Today's `launchAppIntent` unchanged — one explicit-intent helper for both widgets,
  per docs/security-and-privacy.md §6.4.
- `WidgetRefresher` (see above) and the renamed `WidgetRolloverListener` cover both widgets with the same
  multibinding entry: `GlanceWidgetRefresher.refreshAll` calls `updateAll` on `TodayGlanceWidget` and
  `MonthGlanceWidget`, one call each, and its target list is `internal` so a test can verify that without a
  real `AppWidgetManager`.
- Holiday markers are H-series work and are explicitly out of scope: this widget never reads the holiday
  repository. Event dots are M5 T6, below.

**As built (M5 T6, `:widget` + `:core:domain` + `:core:data`).** Event dots on the Month widget, and the
update-on-write path this section's "Data" bullet describes, per the two designs offered there.

- **Update path -- design (a) chosen.** `WidgetUpdater` (`:core:domain`, package `core.domain.widget`,
  `fun interface { fun requestUpdate() }`, deliberately not `suspend` -- it enqueues and returns) is
  called by `RoomEventRepository` (`:core:data`) after every successful write, at the same call sites as
  `ReminderScheduler.reschedule()`, including calendar writes (a visibility or colour change can change
  which days show a dot). Chosen over an app-scoped collector in `:widget` because it needed no new
  process-start wiring: `RoomEventRepository`'s constructor already takes `ReminderScheduler` the same
  way, `RandomEventUidGenerator`; and `docs/contracts/Events.md` §5 already named the shape ("The widget
  updater is declared separately under `core/domain/…/widget/`") before this task started. The
  production implementation, `DebouncedWidgetUpdater` (`:widget`), buffers signals in a
  `MutableSharedFlow` and a single collector coroutine (a Hilt-provided, qualified
  `CoroutineScope(SupervisorJob() + Dispatchers.Default)`) applies `Flow.debounce(1.second)` before
  calling `WidgetRefresher.refreshAll()` -- the same seam `WidgetRolloverListener` uses. Bound in
  `:widget`'s own `WidgetModule`, so `:app` links with no change of its own (it already depends on
  `:widget`). `FakeWidgetUpdater` (`:core:testing`) is the fake.
- **Event dots.** `MonthGlanceWidget.provideGlance` takes one `fetchMonthEventPresence` snapshot of
  `ObserveAgendaUseCase.presence(IfcYearMonth.gregorianRange)` per render -- **not** a continuous
  collection, unlike the future Agenda widget -- bounded by `withTimeoutOrNull(3_000)` and a catch for
  any other exception; either one renders the month with no dots rather than blocking or crashing the
  render. `MonthWidgetState`'s `MonthDayCellState.hasEvent` / `MonthIntercalaryState.hasEvent` mark the
  28 grid cells and the trailing Leap Day / Year Day band (an intercalary day is an ordinary date to the
  events contract, so it can carry a dot exactly like any other day, CLAUDE.md rule 6). A dot is a small
  bullet glyph on its own reserved line beneath the day number, shape/presence rather than colour (CLAUDE.md
  rule 3) and never a count or a title (rule 8); its absence, not a colour, is what "no events" looks
  like. The merged content description appends a plain, resource-backed "Has events." only when *today*
  has one, never a count.
- **Lock-screen category unchanged.** `docs/security-and-privacy.md` §3.2's ruling is "any widget capable
  of showing event titles declares `not_keyguard`"; a dot is presence only, never a title, a count, or a
  calendar name, so the Month widget is not "capable of showing event titles" in the sense that ruling
  means and keeps `widgetCategory="home_screen"` only, unchanged from M5 T3.

### Configuration

- Use an optional config activity with `configuration_optional|reconfigurable`.
- Options are: show the Gregorian line, the weekday mode, and background opacity.
- Settings are stored per widget in Glance `PreferencesGlanceStateDefinition`.

### Picker previews

- Override `providePreview` and call `setWidgetPreview` on API 35 and later.
  - The call is rate-limited to about two per hour.
  - Call it on app start, only when the (versionCode, locale) pair changes.
- Provide an XML `previewLayout` for API 31 to 34.
- Provide a `previewImage` PNG below API 31, generated from a Roborazzi capture.

**As built (M5 T5, `:widget`).**

- **`previewLayout` (API 31-34)** is a real static mock-up, `res/layout/today_widget_preview.xml` /
  `res/layout/month_widget_preview.xml` -- plain `LinearLayout`/`TextView` (RemoteViews-safe, no
  Compose/Glance), every piece of language text a string resource (CLAUDE.md rule 9), on a fixed,
  illustrative sample date chosen to be a regular day on purpose (Today: IFC Sol 13, 2026; Month:
  September 2026, today = IFC day 8, the same date `MonthWidgetStateTest` hand-checks) so a static
  mock-up can never misrepresent Year Day or Leap Day, which have no month/day number of their own
  (CLAUDE.md rule 6). Colours are plain resources (`res/values/colors.xml` +
  `res/values-night/colors.xml`) carrying the same hex values as `:core:designsystem`'s brand light/dark
  schemes, since a static layout cannot run `GlanceTheme`.
- **`previewImage` (verified valid since API 11 against the SDK's own `api-versions.xml`, not API 30 as
  once assumed) lives in the base `res/xml/*_widget_info.xml`**, not a separate qualifier split, and is a
  simple vector drawable rather than a Roborazzi-captured PNG -- a deliberate simplification the task
  authorized over this section's original wording, since API 26-30 is an increasingly small, legacy-only
  audience for a picker thumbnail.
- **`providePreview` + `setWidgetPreview` (API 35+)** reuse `TodayWidgetContent` / `MonthWidgetContent`
  unchanged, the same composables the real widgets render, fed a `Clock.fixed` / literal `ZoneProvider`
  pair on the exact same sample dates as the static layouts above (`TodayGlanceWidget.PREVIEW_CLOCK`,
  `MonthGlanceWidget.PREVIEW_CLOCK`), so the dynamic and static previews cannot drift apart the way two
  independently hand-built mock-ups could. `WidgetPreviewUpdater` (`:widget`, package `widget.preview`)
  is the version/locale guard: SDK-gated (`Build.VERSION_CODES.VANILLA_ICE_CREAM`), persisted in a plain
  `SharedPreferences` file keyed by `"$versionCode|$localeTag"`, and calling
  `PreviewRegistrar.registerPreviews()` -- a seam over `GlanceAppWidgetManager.setWidgetPreviews`,
  exactly like `WidgetRefresher` is a seam over `updateAll`, so the guard logic is unit-tested without
  the real, API-35-only system call. The pair is persisted only when both widgets' calls report success;
  a rate-limited result leaves it unset so the next process start retries. `IfcApplication.onCreate` calls
  `updateIfNeeded()` off the main thread through `AppStartup`, isolated from the reminder re-arm so that
  neither can fail the other.

## 6. Testing strategy

| Layer | Tests | Runner |
|---|---|---|
| `:core:calendar` | Exhaustive round trip for every date in years 1 to 9999 (about 3.65 million): `from(d).toLocalDate()==d`, successor monotonicity, 13x28 plus the intercalary counts per year. | JUnit 6 plus kotest-property. Runs in seconds. |
| | An independent enumeration oracle (build each year's date list by brute force) checked against the arithmetic implementation. | |
| | Golden CSV vectors, from section 3.1 plus historical dates. | |
| | kotest-property for arithmetic laws (plus/minus inverses, clamping, ordering). | |
| | Parse/format round trip, invalid construction, and ordering. | |
| `:core:domain` | Property tests for the recurrence expander. For every IFC rule, each occurrence converts back to a matching `IfcDate`, and Leap Day rules fire only in leap years. | JUnit 6 |
| | DST edge cases with fixed zones. | |
| | Holiday rules against published tables: `HolidayOracleTest` (Easter 1900–2100 Western and Orthodox, OPM federal holidays 2020–2030) in `:core:domain`; `UsPackOracleTest` / `BundledPacksTest` (OPM 2024–2028, 2026 observances, Easter family) in `:core:holidays`. Oracle CSVs carry their source URL and fetch date. | |
| | Agenda bucketing. | |
| `:core:data` | Room 3 DAO tests on the JVM with `BundledSQLiteDriver` in memory. No emulator is needed. | JUnit4 (plus Robolectric only where a Context is needed) |
| | Range-query correctness against a naive filter (property test). | |
| | Migration tests from exported schemas (`core/data/schemas/` is committed). | |
| | DataStore serializer round trip and corruption fallback. | |
| | ICS parser fixtures. | |
| ViewModels | Fakes from `:core:testing`, a fake `Clock` and `DateTicker`, Turbine, and `runTest`. Include a test that advances the clock across midnight. | JUnit4 |
| Compose UI | Stateless `XScreen` tests under Robolectric (`@GraphicsMode(NATIVE)` for any test that depends on text metrics — legacy mode fakes every Text at one height). Cover semantics (content descriptions, selection) and the intercalary band in June 2028 and in December. Library modules pin `sdk=36` in `src/test/resources/robolectric.properties`: without a `targetSdk` in the test manifest Robolectric picks its newest SDK, where the Compose test rule's input injection breaks. | JUnit4 plus Robolectric 4.17 |
| Screenshots | Roborazzi. `generateComposePreviewRobolectricTests` (the Compose preview scanner) auto-captures every `@Preview` it finds; as of R6 / M2 T10 that is wired for `:core:designsystem` only — the features follow once `:core:designsystem`'s goldens are committed and reviewed. | `verifyRoborazziDebug`, guarded in CI (§6 "Goldens") |
| | The MonthGrid matrix {normal, June-leap, December} x {light, dark} x {font 1.0, 2.0} x {compact, expanded} x {LTR, RTL} and the IfcDatePicker matrix {regular, Leap Day, Year Day, clamped, invalid year} x {dark, font 2.0, narrow} are `@Preview` combinations in `MonthGridPreviews.kt` / `IfcDatePickerPreviews.kt`, not hand-written Roborazzi tests — the scanner captures each combination once per preview function. | |
| | Glance widgets through glance-appwidget-testing or previews. | |
| Instrumented | Minimal smoke tests. They run nightly and on manual dispatch, not per push: app launch, a widget receiver smoke test, and the alarm re-arm after `TIME_SET` (adb broadcast). | emulator-runner |

### Goldens

Robolectric native-graphics output differs between Windows and Linux, so CI (Linux) is the only recorder.
Runbook, with the exact commands: [screenshots.md](screenshots.md).

- **Tracked output directory.** `ifc.android.compose` sets `roborazzi { outputDir }` to
  `<module>/src/test/screenshots/` (a tracked source directory, not Roborazzi's gitignored
  `build/outputs/roborazzi` default) and `roborazzi { compare { outputDir } }` to an explicit `build/`
  subdirectory, so `*_actual.png` / `*_compare.png` diff artifacts from a local `compareRoborazziDebug`
  never dirty the tracked directory or need a `.gitignore` rule of their own.
- **Recording.** A `workflow_dispatch` "record-screenshots" job (`.github/workflows/record-screenshots.yml`)
  runs `recordRoborazziDebug` on `ubuntu-latest`, prints a per-module image count to the run summary, and
  uploads the recorded `src/test/screenshots/` trees as a build artifact with their relative paths
  preserved. It does not commit them: every commit in this repo is GPG-signed (WORKFLOW.md §1), and a bot
  cannot hold that key, so the owner downloads the artifact, reviews it, and commits the goldens locally
  with a signed commit.
- **Local and agent runs** use `compareRoborazziDebug`, which never blocks — Windows rendering differs
  from the Linux-recorded goldens by construction, so a local pixel mismatch is not a signal.
  `./gradlew check` does not run any Roborazzi lifecycle task (`record`/`compare`/`verify`) at all, so
  with no goldens tracked every `captureRoboImage` call in `testDebugUnitTest` is a no-op: `check` is
  green whether or not goldens exist, and never fails from a pixel difference.
- **First screenshot tests.** As of R6 / M2 T10, `:core:designsystem` is wired to Roborazzi's Compose
  preview scanner (`roborazzi { generateComposePreviewRobolectricTests { ... } }` in
  `core/designsystem/build.gradle.kts`, using the `sergio-sastre/ComposablePreviewScanner` +
  `roborazzi-compose-preview-scanner-support` libraries, MIT and Apache-2.0 respectively,
  `testImplementation` only). It generates one Robolectric test per `@Preview` under
  `io.github.chrisjmendoza.yearal.core.designsystem`, fixed at `sdk=36`/`qualifiers=w360dp-h640dp-xhdpi`
  and `@GraphicsMode(NATIVE)` for determinism, and currently produces 56 images (the MonthGrid and
  IfcDatePicker preview matrices) with no golden committed yet. No other module has screenshot tests yet;
  they are added module by module once this one's goldens exist and are reviewed.
- **`verifyRoborazziDebug` in CI** is guarded, not unconditional: a step in `ci.yml` checks
  `git ls-files '**/src/test/screenshots/*.png'` and only runs `verifyRoborazziDebug` when that is
  non-empty, so CI stays green with zero goldens and starts enforcing them automatically the moment the
  owner commits the first ones — no manual flag flip needed.

### CI gate per push

`check` (per module: `spotlessCheck`, `lint` on Android modules, `test` — JVM and Robolectric —, the Dokka KDoc
gate on JVM modules) and `:app:assembleDebug`; `verifyRoborazziDebug` runs whenever at least one golden PNG
is tracked in git (guarded, not unconditional — see "Goldens" above).

## 7. CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

- **`ci.yml`**
  - Triggers: pushes to `main`, and pull requests (cloud agents and Dependabot; see WORKFLOW.md §1).
  - Setup: ubuntu-latest, `actions/setup-java` (temurin 21), and `gradle/actions/setup-gradle` with caching.
  - Steps: `./gradlew check :app:assembleDebug`, then `verifyRoborazziDebug` guarded behind a
    `git ls-files` check for tracked goldens (§6 "Goldens").
  - Artifacts: the debug APK on every run; test, lint and Roborazzi diff reports (`build/reports/roborazzi/`,
    `build/outputs/roborazzi/`) on failure.
  - Add concurrency cancellation.
  - Optional: a separate fast job that runs `:core:calendar:test :core:domain:test :core:holidays:test`. It finishes in under a minute and gives agents early feedback.
- **`record-screenshots.yml`:** manual dispatch. See section 6.
- **`nightly.yml`:** instrumented smoke tests on `reactivecircus/android-emulator-runner` (API 26, API 36, and API 37 when images exist), plus a dependency-updates report.
- **`release.yml`:**
  - Trigger: a `v*` tag.
  - Steps: run the full CI gate, build the **unsigned** release bundle to prove the tag builds, and create a GitHub Release with the changelog and the R8 mapping file.
  - For 1.0 the signed AAB is built and uploaded to Play from the owner's machine, because the upload key stays offline (security-and-privacy.md). Signing in CI from GitHub secrets, and automated upload to the internal track, are optional later steps; if adopted, use an upload action rather than Gradle Play Publisher, which has had open AGP 9 compatibility issues.
  - No APKs are attached to GitHub Releases. They would be signed with a different key than the Play build, so users could not cross-update. F-Droid, if pursued, builds from source with its own key.
  - Promotion between tracks happens in the Play Console.
- **Signing:**
  - Use Play App Signing. Google holds the app key and you hold an upload key, which can be reset through Play Console if lost.
  - Keep the keystore out of the repo; `.gitignore` covers keystores, signing properties, and key material.
  - Use the debug keystore for local development.
- **Dependencies and repo hygiene** (details in security-and-privacy.md):
  - Dependabot for the `gradle` and `github-actions` ecosystems with grouped PRs and a cooldown. Review AGP, Kotlin and KSP bumps manually.
  - GitHub Actions pinned by full commit SHA, read-only `GITHUB_TOKEN` by default, secret scanning with push protection, branch protection on `main`, private vulnerability reporting, and a `SECURITY.md`.
  - Repositories restricted with content filtering (`google()`, `mavenCentral()`, Gradle Plugin Portal only); no JitPack, no dynamic versions; Gradle wrapper checksum validated.
  - A CI check compares the merged manifest's permissions against an allow-list, so a dependency cannot silently add `INTERNET` or anything else.
- **Versioning:**
  - Use SemVer in `gradle.properties` (`VERSION_NAME=0.1.0`).
  - `versionCode = major*1_000_000 + minor*10_000 + patch*100 + build`.
  - Tags are `vX.Y.Z`, with a `CHANGELOG.md` in Keep a Changelog style.
- **Play path:** internal track from M2, then closed testing, then production.
  - **Schedule risk:** personal Play developer accounts created after November 2023 must run a closed test with at least 12 testers for 14 continuous days before production access. Start recruiting testers at M5.
- **F-Droid:** there are no proprietary dependencies, so F-Droid is a cheap second channel after 1.0.
- **Privacy policy:** host it on GitHub Pages from this repo and link it in the app. Play requires it, together with the Data safety form, before *any* track including closed testing.

## 8. Security and privacy architecture

[security-and-privacy.md](security-and-privacy.md) holds the threat model and the full decision table. The points that shape the code:

- **Data at rest:** app-private storage only (settings are plain JSON at `filesDir/datastore/user_settings.json`, inside the backup include set), relying on the app sandbox and file-based encryption. **No SQLCipher** — it only helps against root/forensic attackers (out of scope), and an auth-gated key would break widgets, reminders and workers. Caches go in `cacheDir` / `noBackupFilesDir`. Device-calendar data is read live and never copied into Room.
- **No network:** no `INTERNET` permission until URL subscriptions (1.3). This is a verifiable privacy claim and means a compromised dependency cannot exfiltrate anything. No analytics, ads, crash SDK, Firebase or Play Services; Play Console vitals only.
- **Logging:** no event content in release logs, ever. A "Delete all data" action ships in 1.0.
- **Notifications:** reminders use `VISIBILITY_PRIVATE` with a redacted public version. No full-screen intents.
- **Widgets:** any widget that can show event titles ships with a privacy mode (titles / counts only / date only) and `widgetCategory="not_keyguard"` (in an `xml-36` resource folder), because since Android 16 QPR2 widgets are lock-screen eligible by default.
- **App lock (1.x, optional):** `BiometricPrompt` with `BIOMETRIC_WEAK | DEVICE_CREDENTIAL`, no custom PIN. It is a UI gate, not encryption: one gate in `:app` covers launcher entry, widget taps, notification taps, import intents and widget configuration. Enabling it also turns on `FLAG_SECURE`.
- **Backups:** Auto Backup stays on but encrypted-only — `dataExtractionRules` with `disableIfNoEncryptionCapabilities="true"`, plus the legacy `fullBackupContent` for API 30 and below. Verified by a backup → reinstall → restore round trip with `bmgr` before release.
- **Export / import (1.2):** Storage Access Framework only, no storage permissions. Plaintext export warns; optional passphrase encryption uses platform PBKDF2-SHA256 + AES-256-GCM. Restored JSON and imported `.ics` are untrusted input: size/count/length caps, bounded lazy RRULE expansion, imported reminders off by default, plain-text rendering only, transactional import with preview and undo, and a hostile-file test corpus.
- **Components and intents:** minimal exported components; typed, validated intent extras carrying IDs only; immutable explicit `PendingIntent`s; `RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED` for context-registered receivers; no deep links or App Links. Android Lint security checks are CI errors.
- **Permissions by release:** 1.0 — `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` (asked when the first reminder is added), `USE_EXACT_ALARM` / `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` (max SDK 32), `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED`. 1.1 — `READ_CALENDAR`, just-in-time with a rationale. 1.3 — `INTERNET`. Never: `WRITE_CALENDAR`, storage, contacts, location, `AD_ID`.

## 9. Risks

1. **Toolchain freshness.**
   - AGP 9 new DSL and built-in Kotlin with the Hilt, Room 3 and Roborazzi plugins.
   - Robolectric 4.17 is one week old.
   - KSP lags Kotlin 2.4.
   - Mitigation: the M0-T3 spike plus an ADR, and conservative pins (Kotlin 2.3.21, AGP 9.3.3). The fallbacks are Room 2.8.5, or a temporary `android.newDsl=false`.
2. **Play closed-testing gate.** A new personal account needs 12 testers for 14 days, which is the largest calendar-time risk. Confirm your account type now.
3. **`USE_EXACT_ALARM` policy review.** The app should qualify as a calendar app with reminders. If the request is rejected, fall back to the user-granted `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` flow, with `setWindow` for rollover.
4. **OEM background killers** (Xiaomi, Samsung, Huawei) can defeat alarms. The `updatePeriodMillis` backstop and update-on-app-open limit the damage. Document this in the app's help.
5. **Weekday confusion is the core UX risk.** The IFC "Sunday" is not the real Sunday. The dual headers and the Learn screen mitigate it. Decide the default with real users during internal testing.
6. **Agents hallucinating older APIs** (Room 2 packages, Navigation Compose, `kotlin-android` plugin usage). The CLAUDE.md rules and the compile-time gates cover this.
7. **Screenshot goldens across operating systems.** Windows development against Linux CI is solved by CI-only recording, but that adds a step to UI changes.
8. **Scope creep in events.** Per-occurrence edits, attendees and sync are explicitly out of version 1.
