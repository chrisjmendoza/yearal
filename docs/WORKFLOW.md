# Workflow

How work gets done in this repo so that the app is built to spec, tested as it goes, documented as it
goes, and the docs stay true. These rules bind every contributor — human or LLM agent. Rules marked
**[gate]** are enforced by the build or CI; the rest are enforced by review against the checklists here.

## 1. The loop for every task

1. **Read** the docs listed for the area in [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) before writing anything.
2. **State the contract**: which spec sections and which FEATURES IDs the task implements. If the spec
   is silent or ambiguous, stop and resolve it first (§5) — never invent behaviour.
3. **Write tests and code together.** Tests land in the same change as the code they cover.
4. **Document inline**: KDoc with the code, doc updates with the behaviour change (§4).
5. **Run the gate** (§2) locally and read the output.
6. **Self-review** against the Definition of Done (§3), then write the completion report (§6).

**Where commits go depends on who made them.**

- **Local work** (an agent running on the owner's machine): work on a branch named `local/<task>` in
  small, signed commits, and push the branch. **Nothing is merged to `main` until the owner says so** —
  either "merge" for a specific branch, or a blanket permission for the current session. No pull request
  is needed (this is a two-person project); the owner reviews the branch and the completion report (§6)
  in the conversation, then the agent fast-forwards or squashes it onto `main` and deletes the branch.
  The gate is run **before every push**, so every branch tip and `main` are always green; CI runs on
  every branch as the backstop, and a red CI run is fixed before anything else. Merges are
  fast-forwards, so the commit that reaches `main` is the same one CI already passed. Parallel local agents use separate git
  worktrees, one branch each.
- **Cloud work** (scheduled routines and any agent the owner cannot watch): work on a branch named
  `cloud/<task>` and **open a pull request** so the owner can review it before it reaches `main`. Never
  push to `main` from the cloud. The PR description is the completion report (§6). The reviewer runs the
  gate locally, checks the tests against the spec independently (the cloud agent wrote both), and merges
  by fast-forward or squash.
- Dependabot's PRs are handled like cloud PRs.

## 2. The gate

```powershell
$env:JAVA_HOME = "C:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio\jbr"; $env:PATH = "$env:JAVA_HOME\bin;$env:PATH"
.\gradlew.bat check          # everything below, for every module
python scripts\check_docs.py # doc link and reference check
```

`check` currently runs, per module:

| Step | What it enforces |
|---|---|
| `compileKotlin` | `explicitApi()` and **all warnings as errors** **[gate]** |
| `test` | JUnit 6 + Kotest, including the spec-driven and exhaustive tests **[gate]** |
| `spotlessCheck` | ktlint formatting (`.\gradlew.bat spotlessApply` fixes it) **[gate]** |
| `dokkaGenerate` | **KDoc on every public declaration** (pure-JVM modules) — an undocumented one fails the build **[gate]**; Android modules are review-enforced until Dokka is added there (ADR 0001) |
| `lint` | Android modules: Android Lint with `warningsAsErrors` **[gate]** |
| `testDebugUnitTest` | Android modules: JUnit4 + Robolectric (+ Roborazzi `compare`, never `verify`, locally) **[gate]** |

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs the same gate on every branch plus `:app:assembleDebug`, and uploads
the debug APK as an artifact. It also runs `verifyRoborazziDebug`, but only when at least one golden PNG
is tracked in git (a `git ls-files '**/src/test/screenshots/*.png'` check gates the step) — see
[screenshots.md](screenshots.md) for how the owner records that first baseline (ROADMAP R6 / M2 T10).
A Kotest `checkAll` inside an expression-bodied test (`fun x() = runBlocking { checkAll(...) }`) returns a
non-`Unit` value and Jupiter silently skips it — use a block body and check the test-results XML counts.
Robolectric pauses the main looper, and its clock does **not** follow real time. Anything on
`Dispatchers.Main` — including `viewModelScope`, so most `stateIn` sharing — advances only when the test
pumps the looper (`shadowOf(Looper.getMainLooper()).idle()`); `Thread.sleep` advances nothing. A test that
reads `.value` once after a single pump passes on an idle machine and fails under load or on CI. Pump in a
bounded loop until the value arrives, and fail with a message saying what never came. Separately, a flow
shared `WhileSubscribed` does not run at all unless something collects it: if the only subscriber is the
Compose tree, subscribe in the test instead of resting on composition having produced a frame.

## 3. Definition of Done

A task is done only when **all** of these are true:

- [ ] Behaviour matches the cited spec sections; every FEATURES ID touched is named in the commit message.
- [ ] New or changed behaviour has tests **in the same commit series, pushed together**. Bug fixes start with a failing test.
- [ ] Every `when` over `IfcDate` and every date UI handles Year Day and Leap Day, and a test proves it.
- [ ] Anything that shows "today" has a test that crosses midnight with a fake `Clock`.
- [ ] Every public declaration has KDoc that meets §4.1.
- [ ] Docs changed in the same push wherever behaviour, structure, versions, or scope changed (§4.2).
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` has an entry under *Unreleased* for anything user-visible or architectural, and
      [`README.md`](../README.md)'s status and feature list change in the same push as any user-visible
      feature (§4.2).
- [ ] The full gate passes locally, and the completion report quotes the real result.
- [ ] No leftovers: no `TODO()` or stub in `main`, no commented-out code, no debug logging, no unused
      dependency.

## 4. Documentation rules

### 4.1 KDoc standard

KDoc is mandatory on every public class, function, and property **[gate]**. Good KDoc here:

- Says **what the declaration means and guarantees**, not how it is implemented.
- States units, ranges, nullability meaning, and what is thrown (`@throws`) — e.g. "1..28", "`null` for
  intercalary days".
- **Cites the spec** for anything rule-driven: ``Spec: `docs/calendar-spec.md` §3.1``.
- Calls out traps in bold where a caller could plausibly get it wrong (nominal vs actual weekday, the
  numeric form looking like an ISO date).
- Links related symbols with `[brackets]`. No filler ("Gets the year").
- Non-obvious `internal`/`private` logic gets a short comment explaining *why*.

### 4.2 Keeping docs true (anti-drift)

1. **One authority per topic.** The table at the top of [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) says which
   doc owns what. Other docs link to the owner instead of restating it. When two docs disagree, the
   owner wins and the other is fixed in the same push.
2. **Executable specs beat prose.** Where a doc contains checkable facts, a test reads the doc:
   - `SpecVectorsTest` parses the vector tables in `calendar-spec.md` §6 and fails if the code
     disagrees or if the row count changes **[gate]**.
   - The same pattern applies to future data: holiday tables vs published dates, the permission
     allow-list vs the merged manifest, the module list vs `settings.gradle.kts`.
3. **Code is the authority for versions.** `gradle/libs.versions.toml` is what the build uses.
   ARCHITECTURE.md §1 explains *why*; after the M0 toolchain ADR it links to the catalog rather than
   repeating numbers.
4. **Same-push rule.** A change to behaviour, a module boundary, a permission, a dependency, a
   release scope, or a priority must update the owning doc in the same push. "Docs later" is not a state.
   [`README.md`](../README.md)'s status and feature list are a consumer of every owning doc, not an owner
   itself, but it drifts just as easily: its "what works today" / "what's not here yet" split and its status
   line change in the same push as any user-visible feature, the same way `CHANGELOG.md` does.
5. **Decisions are recorded, not remembered.** Anything that changes or fills a gap in the architecture
   or spec gets an ADR in [docs/adr/](adr/) and a pointer from the owning doc.
6. **Roadmap is a ledger.** Finishing a ROADMAP task ticks it (or strikes it) in the push that finishes
   it. Scope moved between releases is edited in both ROADMAP.md and FEATURES.md.
7. **Links must resolve.** `scripts/check_docs.py` fails on any relative markdown link that does not
   point at an existing file **[gate]**. Link to files rather than naming them in prose, so renames and
   deletions are caught.
8. **Docs carry a status line** (planning baseline / current as of milestone X). A doc known to be stale
   says so at the top until it is fixed.
9. **Frozen contracts** live in `docs/contracts/`. Changing a frozen public API requires an ADR and an
   update to the contract doc.

## 5. When the spec is silent, ambiguous, or wrong

Do not guess and do not quietly diverge. In order of preference:

1. If the answer is derivable from another authoritative doc, use it and cite it.
2. Otherwise write a short ADR proposing the rule, update the owning doc, and implement that.
3. If it is a product decision (naming, scope, UX default), ask the owner; list it under
   "Open decisions" in ROADMAP.md if it can wait.

If a test fails and you believe the *spec* is wrong, keep the test, leave the code alone, and report it.

## 6. Rules for LLM agents

These exist because the common LLM failure modes are: claiming success without running anything,
weakening tests until they pass, inventing APIs from older library versions, and leaving docs behind.

**Before**

- Read the required docs. Quote the spec section numbers you are implementing in your plan.
- Check the version catalog before using any library API; this project uses Room 3, Navigation 3, and
  AGP 9 (CLAUDE.md, "API generations"). If unsure an API exists, look at the dependency's sources
  rather than recalling from memory.
- Stay inside your module. If the task needs a change elsewhere, report it; do not reach across.
- **Every delegated task brief must include the documentation step**: which KDoc is expected, which owning
  doc(s) need updating, and the `CHANGELOG.md`/`README.md` text being proposed to the coordinator. A brief
  that only describes code and tests is incomplete, whether it is written by a human or by another agent.

**During**

- Never make a test pass by weakening it: no deleting assertions, loosening expected values,
  `@Disabled`, `@Suppress`, `assumeTrue`, or catching and ignoring. If a test is wrong, say why with a
  spec citation and fix it; if the code is wrong, fix the code.
- Never edit a spec table, golden file, or expected value to match your output. Those are inputs.
- Never bypass a gate: no `--no-verify`, no removing `allWarningsAsErrors`, no lowering Dokka or lint
  strictness, no skipping commit signing, no `-x test`.
- No placeholder implementations, fake data, or "simplified for now" logic presented as done. If you
  cannot finish something, leave it out and say so.
- No new dependency, permission, or module without the doc update and justification in the same push.
- The implementation of correctness-critical logic and its oracle tests are written by **different
  agents**, and the test author works from the spec, not from the implementation.

**After — the completion report**

End every task with this, truthfully:

```text
Task:        <roadmap task / FEATURES IDs>
Spec:        <doc §sections implemented>
Changed:     <files, grouped by module>
Tests:       <new/changed test classes; what each proves>
Gate:        <exact commands run and their real results, including test counts>
Docs:        <docs updated, or "none needed because …">
Not done:    <anything skipped, deferred, or uncertain — never empty by default>
Found:       <spec ambiguities, bugs in other modules, drift noticed>
```

- The "Docs:" line **must name `README.md`** whenever the task changed user-visible behaviour — either
  what was updated in it, or why it genuinely needed no change (e.g. "none, this is a pure refactor with
  no user-visible effect"). Silence on README is not an acceptable answer for a user-visible change.
- "Gate" must be the output of commands actually run in this session. If a command was not run, write
  "not run" — never infer a pass.
- A reviewer (human or another agent) spot-checks the report against the diff. A report that claims
  something the diff does not show is treated as a failed task, whatever the code quality.

## 7. Review checklist (for the reviewer, human or agent)

1. Does the diff do what the cited spec sections say — including the floating days?
2. Would the tests fail if the feature were broken? (Mentally delete the core line.)
3. Is any test weaker than before? Any expected value changed without a spec citation?
4. Is every public symbol documented to §4.1, and is the KDoc *true*?
5. Did behaviour change without its owning doc changing?
6. Rules in CLAUDE.md: no `now()` outside `Clock`, no bare `dayOfWeek`, no dates computed outside
   `:core:calendar`, no event content in logs, strings in resources, module boundaries respected.
7. Is the completion report consistent with the diff and the CI result?
