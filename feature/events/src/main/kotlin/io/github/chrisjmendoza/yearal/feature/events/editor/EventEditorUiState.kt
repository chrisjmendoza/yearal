    /**
     * @property isNew `true` while creating an event; `false` while editing one.
     * @property title one line, at most [io.github.chrisjmendoza.yearal.core.domain.event.Event.MAX_TITLE_LENGTH]; may be blank.
     * @property description free text, at most [io.github.chrisjmendoza.yearal.core.domain.event.Event.MAX_DESCRIPTION_LENGTH].
     * @property location free text, at most [io.github.chrisjmendoza.yearal.core.domain.event.Event.MAX_LOCATION_LENGTH].
     * @property isAllDay `true` for an all-day event.
     * @property startDate the effective start date: [EventDraft.startDate], or today while it is `null`.
     * @property startIfcLabel [startDate] in the IFC long style, with its `IFC` marker context (CLAUDE.md rule 5).
     * @property startIfcDayLabel [startDate]'s IFC day named within its month, no year (`Sol 13`) — the
     *   "yearly on this IFC date" recurrence option's label, where the year would be misleading.
     * @property startGregorianLabel [startDate] in the Gregorian long style.
     * @property startGregorianDayLabel [startDate]'s Gregorian month and day, no year (`Jun 18`) — the
     *   "yearly on this Gregorian date" recurrence option's label.
     * @property allDayEndDate the effective all-day end date (inclusive); only meaningful when [isAllDay].
     * @property allDayEndBeforeStart `true` when [allDayEndDate] is before [startDate] — blocks saving.
     * @property startMinuteOfDay the timed start, 0..1439; only meaningful when not [isAllDay].
     * @property endMinuteOfDay the timed end, 0..1439, same day as [startDate]; only meaningful when not [isAllDay].
     * @property endBeforeStart `true` when [endMinuteOfDay] is before [startMinuteOfDay] — blocks saving.
     * @property zoneChoice device (floating) or a fixed zone.
     * @property fixedZoneId the zone used when [zoneChoice] is [ZoneChoice.FIXED].
     * @property recurrenceKind which recurrence is selected.
     * @property monthlyIfcAvailable `false` on Year Day and Leap Day — hide "monthly (IFC)" then (CLAUDE.md rule 6).
     * @property isLeapDayAnchor `true` when [startDate] is Leap Day — only then is [leapDayPolicy] asked for.
     * @property leapDayPolicy the common-year policy for a Leap Day yearly rule (FEATURES E6).
     * @property recurrenceEndKind never / until / count.
     * @property untilDate the effective "until" date (defaults to one year after [startDate] until the user picks one).
     * @property untilBeforeStart `true` when [untilDate] is before [startDate] — blocks saving.
     * @property count the effective occurrence count, `≥ 1`.
     * @property reminders the selected minutes-before presets.
     * @property canSave `false` while any blocking condition above holds.
     * @property isDirty `true` once the draft differs from what was first loaded — gates the unsaved-changes guard.
     * @property saveFailed `true` after [save][EventEditorViewModel.save] failed soft (the event or its
     *   calendar was deleted elsewhere) — never a crash (CLAUDE.md rule: no `TODO()` or stub, and per
     *   `docs/contracts/Events.md` T4 guidance to catch `IllegalArgumentException` and fail soft).
     * @property showDeleteConfirm the delete confirmation dialog is open.
     * @property showDiscardConfirm the unsaved-changes (back) confirmation dialog is open.
     * @property exdateCount how many occurrences of this event were individually deleted ("delete this
     *   occurrence" from Day detail), `0` for a new event or one with none. Per-occurrence *edits* stay
     *   out of scope for 1.0 (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §3.2 "Scope cuts"); this count and
     *   [EventEditorViewModel.restoreAllOccurrences] are the one thing the editor offers about them.
     * @property showNotificationPermissionNotice `true` after the user denied the in-context
     *   `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` request (FEATURES E4, P2): a quiet, dismissible explanation that
     *   reminders are still saved but notifications are off. Saving is never blocked by this.
     * @property isSaving `true` while [EventEditorViewModel.save] or
     *   [EventEditorViewModel.confirmDelete] has a write in flight (ROADMAP R2): the Save and Delete
     *   actions are disabled and a progress indicator shows, so a second tap before the first write
     *   lands is a no-op instead of a second insert. Cleared on both success and failure.
     * @property showRecurrenceResetNotice `true` right after the editor reset [recurrenceKind] from
     *   [RecurrenceKind.MONTHLY_IFC] to [RecurrenceKind.NONE] on its own (ROADMAP R3), because the start
     *   moved to Year Day or Leap Day — which belong to no month — while "monthly (IFC)" was chosen. A
     *   dismissible, TalkBack-announced explanation; dismissing it never reopens on its own.
     * @property yearlyIfcGregorianShifts `true` when [RecurrenceKind.YEARLY_IFC] anchored on [startDate]
     *   lands on a different Gregorian date in leap years than in common years (ROADMAP R4;
     *   `docs/calendar-spec.md` §7.7). Always `false` for Year Day and Leap Day.
     * @property yearlyGregorianIfcShifts `true` when [RecurrenceKind.YEARLY_GREGORIAN] anchored on
     *   [startDate] lands on a different IFC date in leap years than in common years (ROADMAP R4;
     *   `docs/calendar-spec.md` §7.7). `false` for February 29, which has no common-year analogue to
     *   compare against.
