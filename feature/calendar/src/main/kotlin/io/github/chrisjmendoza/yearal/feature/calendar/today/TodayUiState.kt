     * @property date today in the IFC, the source of every other property.
     * @property gregorianDate the same physical day in the Gregorian calendar.
     * @property heroWeekday today's **actual** (real-world) weekday, unlabelled (`Thursday`), shown
     * above [heroDate] — never the IFC nominal weekday, which would tell the user the wrong day
     * (spec §4.1 item 2). Present on Leap Day and Year Day too: they have no IFC weekday, but every
     * day has a real one.
     * @property heroDate the long style (`September 8, 2026`, `Leap Day, 2028`, `Year Day, 2026`).
     * @property mediumDate the medium style (`Sep 8, 2026`).
     * @property numericDate the canonical numeric style with its mandatory prefix (`IFC 2026-10-08`).
     * @property gregorianLongDate the Gregorian date with its real weekday (`Thursday, September 17, 2026`).
     * @property nominalWeekday the labelled IFC weekday (`IFC weekday: Sunday`) or `no IFC weekday` on
     * Leap Day and Year Day. **Not the real weekday** — spec §4.1.
     * @property actualWeekday the labelled real weekday (`Actual weekday: Thursday`).
     * @property weekdaysDescription both weekdays in spoken form (`IFC Sunday, actual Thursday`).
     * @property dayAndWeek `Day 260 · Week 38 of 52`, or `Day 169 · outside the weeks` (spec §7.4).
     * @property quarter `Q3` (spec §7.5).
     * @property yearProgress fraction of the year elapsed, day of year over the year's length, in (0, 1].
     * @property yearProgressLabel [yearProgress] as text, `71% of the year`.
     * @property countdown days until the next Leap Day or Year Day, whichever comes first
     * (`105 days until Year Day`); `null` only when there is none inside the supported year range.
     * @property agenda today's own event occurrences (FEATURES T5), all-day first then by start time;
     * empty when there are none.
     * @property holidays display labels of today's enabled holidays, in holiday-engine order; empty
     * when there are none.
     * @property nextHolidayDays days from today until [nextHolidayName] (FEATURES T5), `> 0`; `null`
     * when no enabled set has an upcoming holiday in the search window.
     * @property nextHolidayName the next upcoming holiday's display label, paired with
     * [nextHolidayDays]; `null` exactly when that is.
