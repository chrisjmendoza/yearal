/**
 * What the Month pager and its day card show (docs/FEATURES.md C1, C3, C5, C7; docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §4
 * "Screen behaviors"). Immutable; a new value is built whenever the page, the selection, the settings
 * or the ticker's date change, so "today" is never cached across midnight.
 *
 * Every date is Gregorian (CLAUDE.md rule 4): the grid matches today and the selection by Gregorian
 * date and converts each cell through `:core:calendar` itself.
 *
 * @property currentPage the page the pager last reported, `0..MonthPages.LAST_PAGE`; the page the
 * pager starts on when the screen is first composed.
 * @property today the real today, or `null` before the first date tick (no cell is marked).
 * @property todayPage the page showing [today], or `null` before the first tick. The "Today" action's
 * target; the action is hidden while [currentPage] equals it.
 * @property selected the day last tapped, or `null` for no selection.
 * @property weekdayDisplay which header rows the grids show (the user setting).
 * @property holidaysByMonth holiday label per Gregorian date, keyed by month, for the current page
 * and its two neighbours (the pages kept warm), from the enabled holiday sets. A month without a
 * holiday maps to an empty map; a month not yet evaluated is absent.
 * @property eventCountsByMonth number of event occurrences per Gregorian date, keyed by month, for the
 * same warm pages as [holidaysByMonth] (FEATURES C4). A date with no event is absent (read as `0`); a
 * month not yet evaluated is absent entirely.
 * @property dayDetail the day card's full content for [summaryDate] (`docs/design-plan.md` §4.2, owner
 * note 2, superseded by the day-card merge: the popup Day detail is gone, this card is now the whole
 * detail), already formatted; `null` before the first date tick, when there is no day to build it for
 * yet.
