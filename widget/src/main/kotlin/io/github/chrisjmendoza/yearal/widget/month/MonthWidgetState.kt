/**
 * One of the 28 regular-day cells in the month grid, in row-major order (CLAUDE.md rule 1: the day
 * itself is `:core:calendar`'s [IfcDate.Regular]; this only carries what the widget renders).
 *
 * @property dayOfMonth 1..28.
 * @property gregorianDate the real, Gregorian date of this cell (CLAUDE.md rule 4). It builds the
 *   cell's tap target ([io.github.chrisjmendoza.yearal.widget.today.dayLaunchIntent], ROADMAP M3 T5),
 *   and at the widget's larger responsive size its day of month is also shown under the IFC number,
 *   the same pairing the app's own `MonthGrid` cell uses (FEATURES C1).
 * @property isToday whether this cell is the real today, matched by **Gregorian** date (CLAUDE.md
 *   rule 4 -- events, "today", and everything else tied to real life compare Gregorian dates, never
 *   IFC numeric fields).
 * @property hasEvent whether at least one event occurrence falls on this day (ROADMAP M5 T6,
 *   `docs/contracts/Events.md` §5 "`ObserveAgendaUseCase.presence`"). Holidays are never counted, per
 *   the same contract. Carries no event content (CLAUDE.md rule 8) -- a plain boolean, never a count or
 *   a title.
 * @property hasHoliday whether at least one holiday of an enabled set falls on this day
 *   ([fetchMonthHolidays]). Separate from [hasEvent] because the two are drawn as different marks, the
 *   same distinction the app's own `DayMarks` makes (FEATURES C4): shape, never colour alone
 *   (CLAUDE.md rule 3). Also a plain boolean and never a name -- a holiday's label is screen content,
 *   not home-screen content.

 *
 * @property label the day's name without a year (`Leap Day`, `Year Day`; [IfcDateFormatter.formatDay]).
 * @property subtitle the Gregorian date, its real weekday, and the "no IFC weekday" note
 *   ([IfcDateFormatter.intercalarySubtitle]) -- the day belongs to no week (spec §2.4), so it is never
 *   given a nominal weekday.
 * @property gregorianDate the real, Gregorian date of this band (CLAUDE.md rule 4), used to build its

 *   Leap Day and Year Day are ordinary dates and get their own tap target exactly like a grid cell.

 *   the today highlight, since it is not part of the 4x7 grid.
 * @property hasEvent whether at least one event occurrence falls on this intercalary day (ROADMAP M5
 *   T6) -- Leap Day and Year Day are ordinary dates to the events contract (`docs/contracts/Events.md`
 *   §1.2) and so can carry events like any other day, and CLAUDE.md rule 6 requires this case be
 *   handled explicitly rather than silently dropped because the day is not one of the 28 grid cells.

 * `Clock`/`ZoneProvider` every time, CLAUDE.md rule 2): nothing here is a cached date, and rebuilding
 * this state is what makes the shown month self-correct across a midnight or year rollover.
 *
 * @property monthTitle the month name and year (`Sol 2028`).
 * @property nominalWeekdayHeaders the seven nominal IFC weekday short names, Sunday first -- identical
 *   in every month and year (spec §2.3, R6).
 * @property actualWeekdayHeaders the seven real-world weekday short names of this month's columns
 *   ([IfcYearMonth.actualDayOfWeek]); differs month to month and shifts by one after Leap Day

 * @property days the 28 regular-day cells, row-major, [GRID_COLUMNS] per row.
 * @property intercalary the trailing Leap Day / Year Day band, or `null` for a month with neither.

 *   [IfcDateFormatter.gregorianSpan]), shown only at the widget's larger responsive size.
 * @property contentDescription the single merged TalkBack description for the whole tappable widget:
 *   the month title, today's IFC date with both labelled weekdays and its Gregorian equivalent
 *   ([IfcDateFormatter.dayDescription]), whether today has an event (ROADMAP M5 T6, present only as a
 *   plain "has events" hint -- never a count or a title, CLAUDE.md rule 8), and the tap hint.
 *   Deliberately **not** one description per day cell -- the app's full month grid gives every cell its
 *   own rich description (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §4 "Accessibility"), which would be 28-plus nodes on a
 *   home-screen widget; a single description here is the one TalkBack needs to say what today is
 *   without reading every number on the grid.

/**
 * Builds the [MonthWidgetState] for the IFC month containing [today] -- the month the widget always

 * that lands on Leap Day or Year Day shows that month with its band highlighted, not a page for the day

 *   (`ObserveAgendaUseCase.presence`, ROADMAP M5 T6), from [fetchMonthEventPresence]. Defaults to empty
 *   for callers that do not care about event dots (most tests, and any render where the snapshot timed
 *   out or failed -- see [fetchMonthEventPresence]'s KDoc).
 * @param hasEventsLabel the localized "has events" hint appended to [MonthWidgetState.contentDescription]
 *   when today has an event; the empty default appends nothing, which also keeps every existing caller
 *   that does not pass one byte-for-byte unchanged.
 * @param holidayDates the Gregorian dates in this month carrying a holiday from an enabled set
 *   ([fetchMonthHolidays]). Defaults to empty, which renders every day without a holiday mark -- the
 *   same "absent rather than wrong" fallback a timed-out snapshot produces.
