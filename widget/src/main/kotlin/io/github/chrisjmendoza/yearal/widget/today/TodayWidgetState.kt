 * `remember`, because the whole point of `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §5's layered rollover is that a call to
 * this function is what makes a stale render impossible — caching it anywhere would silently reintroduce
 * the "widget just stays on whatever date it was when added" bug named in FEATURES S3 and S1.

 * @property yearProgressLabel how far through the year today is (`Day 260 of 365 · 71%`,
 *   [io.github.chrisjmendoza.yearal.widget.today.yearProgressLabel]), shown only at
 *   [TodayGlanceWidget.LARGE] (design-plan §4.9, "large widgets should show more").
 * @property countdownLabel the countdown to the next Leap Day or Year Day (`Year Day in 105 days`,
 *   [io.github.chrisjmendoza.yearal.widget.today.countdownLabel]), shown alongside
 *   [yearProgressLabel]; `null` only past [IfcDate.MAX_YEAR].

 *   dates, the labelled weekdays, "Today.", and a hint that double-tapping opens the app.
